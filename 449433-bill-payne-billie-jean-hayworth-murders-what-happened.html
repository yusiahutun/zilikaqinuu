As is the norm, many people perceive social media platforms as avenues for communication, sharing photos, and having fun. But sometimes, it can turn into a dark place rampant with cyberbullying and even death threats. Unfortunately, Bill Payne and Billie Jean Hayworth fell on the wrong side of this narrative, which eventually cost their lives. And what is the backstory? You will hardly believe how an individual perceived the most innocent played her parents' and boyfriend's mind to orchestrate a murder.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0348febfb85ca7fa.jpeg><p class=align-left>It is nine years later, but the narrative is still hardly conceivable. Bill and Billie Jean's murder story is convoluted to the core as it is hard to conceive. The individual at the centre of it, Jenelle, allegedly used her naïve mother, father, and boyfriend as pawns.</p><p class=align-left>Even though her ingenious scheme is quite commendable, the result of her actions (the murder of two people) makes it awful. So, what is the backstory of the Facebook murders, and where are the culprits today?</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fb70d55837c39dc2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Physically Challenged Man Given Weeks to Live, Marries Fiancé in Beautiful Beach Wedding: "Love of My Life"</span></p></a><h2>Who is Jenelle Potter?</h2><p class=align-left>The Potter family case brought significant attention to the sleepy and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">friendly town</a> of Mountain City in Tennessee. Which makes one wonder about the gruesomeness of the crime to make it a headliner. The back story is quite fascinating, and it involves social media and jealousy that turned deadly.</p><p class=align-left>Jenelle Potter was born in 1981 and lived with her parents and her younger sibling in the small town where they moved in 2004. Her parents were highly protective of her and watched her every move. Jenelle's father was a former marine who worked briefly for the CIA after serving in Vietnam and retired to a quiet life.</p><p class=align-left>On the other hand, Jenelle's mother, Barbara, worked at Hewlett-Packard. Unfortunately, Jenelle had several health concerns and was living a sheltered life. She experienced learning difficulties and had hearing difficulties. Also, she was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes when she was small.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/29f7f60421339144.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Mike Tyson's daughter? Everything you need to know</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Therefore, it was hard for her to make friends while in the town. The only way that she could easily make friends was through social media, primarily Facebook.</p><p class=align-left>But she was fortunate to make friends with Tracy Greenwell, a <a href=#>pharmacy</a> clerk where she picked her medication regularly. She later had a crush on her brother, Billy Payne, after spotting him while hanging out with Tracy.</p><p class=align-left>However, Tracy had other plans for Jenelle, and instead of connecting her with Billy, she linked her with her cousin, Jamie Curd, who was single. And that was the beginning of their secret relationship, which Jenelle's parents were not supposed to know.</p><h2>Who were Bill Payne and Billie Jean Hayworth?</h2><p class=align-left>You are likely trying to figure out <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">who the victims</a> in the Potter family murders were. Billie Jean Hayworth was born in 1988 in Tennessee, United States of America.</p><p class=align-left>Billie was a country girl and liked playing sports. She started dating Billy Payne after graduating from high school in 2006.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a9ba9ab55daad5d6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Sandra Bullock's son: Everything you should know about Louis Bardo Bullock</span></p></a><p class=align-left>On the other hand, Billy Payne was born in 1975 in North Carolina. He had similar interests to her girlfriend, so they enjoyed each other's company. Billy and Billie welcomed their son in 2011, and everything seemed fine.</p><h2>How did the online feud start?</h2><p class=align-left>Arguments are alright, but sometimes things might go overboard, and this was the case with Jenelle Potter, Billy and his girlfriend. So, how did it all start?</p><p class=align-left>Once Jenelle started dating Jamie, she started getting online threats from an unknown person. These messages started coming in between 2009 and 2010.</p><p class=align-left>Jenelle blamed Billie Jean, Billy's girlfriend. And that was the beginning of the Facebook feud that lasted for quite some time. Everything got worse when Billie learnt that Jamie was taking his girlfriend's side instead of siding with his cousin, Billy.</p><p class=align-left>Jenelle believed that Billie was targeting her with online threats and cyberbullying because she was jealous of her great looks. And the feud turned to rock-throwing by Billy and Billie Jean at Jenelle's house.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9b05bf07e7ba18b0.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Shane Maguire and Nicole Curtis: relationship, baby, latest updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>They unfriended each other on Facebook, and things seemed like they cooled down, but the matter got even worse as a double murder happened.</p><h2>How did Billi and Bill die?</h2><p class=align-left>Police found Bill and Billie Jean in their house in a pool of blood and <a href=#>their infant</a> sitting beside the dead parents. Also, the couple had bruises all over their bodies, indicative of battery before being shot. They both died from a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">single gunshot</a> to each of their faces.</p><p class=align-left>Also, Billy Payne's throat had been slashed as he lay in bed, and it was clear that the mother had cradled their baby in her arms when she died.

After a few hours in the interrogation room, Jamie informed the investigators that Jenelle's dad murdered Billy and Billie Hayworth.</p><p class=align-left>After searching Marvin’s house, they discovered numerous weapons, but none matched the <a href=#>murder weapon</a>.

According to Marvin's testimony, he and only him murdered the two victims.

Meet the Woman Who Was Close to Holding the Title</h1><div id=sub-header>October 2024 · 4 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p><strong>A peek into the life of the woman who almost became Antonio Brown’s wife and her on-and-off love story with the former NFL player.</strong></p><p>Chelsie Kyriss was romantically involved with famous American NFL player Antonio Brown for many years. She is also the mother of three of his children.&nbsp;</p><p>The couple had an on-and-off relationship filled with so much drama.&nbsp;But each time their relationship hit a major obstacle, the reason was more or less the same: Antonio Brown cheated.</p><p>But who is Chelsie Kyriss? And how has all this drama defined her relationship with Antonio Brown?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Chelsie_Kyriss></span>Who Is Chelsie Kyriss?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Chelsie Kyriss was born in Springboro, Ohio, on September 1, 1989. Her parents are Todd and Lynn Kyriss.&nbsp;</p><p>Not much is known about Chelsie’s early or adult life as she lives a private life despite her drama-filled relationship with the former NFL player Antonio Brown. But we know her father, Todd, handles the duty operations at Elite Sportswear, Pennsylvania, and has been the department’s executive vice president since 2019.&nbsp;</p><p>Chelsie also has a brother, Christopher Kyriss, who is married to Beth Kyriss.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot_20230418-184354_1.jpg><p>Chelsie attended Springboro High School and studied at Sinclair Community College, where she graduated in 2010. She also attended Georgia State University Perimeter College and earned a Bachelor’s degree.</p><p>Chelsie Kyriss has worked as a teacher, store manager, and customer care representative. She is also an <a href=#>Instagram</a> influencer with over 106K followers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Was_Chelsie_Kyriss_Ever_Antonio_Browns_Wife></span>Was Chelsie Kyriss Ever Antonio Brown’s Wife?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Many have wondered who exactly Chelsie Kyriss is to Antonio Brown. Is she his wife, girlfriend, or baby mama?&nbsp;</p><p>Brown has dated several ladies over the years, including Shameika Brailsford, with whom he had his first child in 2007. He also dated Wiltrice Jackson and had his second child with her.&nbsp;</p><p>He later met and started dating Chelsie Kyriss, who had two children from a prior relationship. No one knows the exact timeline of Brown and Chelsie’s relationship, but the two reportedly met through a mutual friend in 2012 and started dating that same year. Since then, their relationship has suffered frequent ups and downs and too much drama.&nbsp;</p><p>However, despite their tumultuous relationship, the two got engaged in 2020 but broke it off soon after. So, Chelsie was never Antonio Brown’s wife.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Many_Children_Does_Chelsie_Kyriss_Have></span>How Many Children Does Chelsie Kyriss Have?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Although she was never Antonio Brown’s wife, Chelsie has three kids, Autonomy Brown, Ali Brown, and Apollo Brown, with the former NFL player. She is also the mother of Kellen and Brooklyn Green from her prior relationship.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot_20230418-184340_1.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_Chelsie_Kyriss_Never_Became_Antonio_Browns_Wife></span>Why Chelsie Kyriss Never Became Antonio Brown’s Wife<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Chelsie’s relationship with Antonio Brown was filled with drama and scandal. For instance, in 2017, she reportedly filed a lawsuit against Brown for creating a hostile home environment for their kids.&nbsp;</p><p>Brown then accused Chelsie of stealing his Bentley during a live Instagram stream. In another incident, he threw a bag of penis-shaped candy at the police, demanding they arrest Chelsie.</p><p>Brown accused Chelsie of being an unfit mother on many occasions. On the other hand, the mom-of-five has accused him of cheating many times. Chelsie has also claimed that she repeatedly asked Brown to seek professional help for his mental health issues, but he has always ignored her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot_20230418-184324_1.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Sex_Tape_Controversy></span>The Sex Tape Controversy<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The couple made headlines in January 2023 when Antonio Brown publicly shared an explicit photo and video on his Snapchat account. The image and video reveal his private area and Chelsie having oral sex with him.</p><p>Chelsie addressed this in an Instagram post, saying she was aware of it but didn’t condone it. She also revealed she had reported Brown’s account and the pictures, but Snapchat was still letting him repost them.&nbsp;</p><p>Snapchat eventually suspended the account, as it has strict policies about explicit content, and promised to investigate the matter. However, Brown later posted on Twitter that his Snapchat account was hacked. He said he was responsible for leaking the sensitive video.&nbsp;</p><p>While it’s unclear when the video and photo were taken, reports suggest they aren’t recent. At this point, it seems Chelsie may never be Antonio Brown’s wife, and their <a href=#>love story</a> has ended. However, with three kids between them, the ex-lovers haven’t seen the last of each other.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kxKm7jKKqZpmeqbyvtc5mmaunp6N6uLXFnmSmnZWperW0xGauqKWRo3q4tM5mrpqrXZi5sL%2FEZquoZZikuaW1zaBkraCVYsGqwMueZg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./emmys-ru-paul-responds-to-backlash-over-drag-queen-library-readings.html>&#171;&nbsp;Emmys: Ru Paul responds to backlash over drag queen library readings</a>

A royal expert has said Prince Harry, who lives in a mansion in Montecito, will be feeling the pinch after a recent court setback.</strong></p><p>The Duke’s recent court setback in Britain this week comes as he faces a newspaper over an article about his legal fight with the Home Office. The original case was surrounding concerns of security when he is back on home turf. <a href=#>Prince Harry</a>, who resides in Montecito in a mansion with Meghan and their children, left his homeland in 2020. <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> and their son Archie, at the time, went with the now 39-year-old. At first, they moved to Canada, before settling down in California.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-harry-lonely-in-montecito-mansion-after-recent-setbacks>‘Prince Harry lonely’ in Montecito mansion after recent setbacks</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-1352553242-1-1024x759.jpg><p>A royal expert has commented on whether Prince Harry may be feeling the pinch in his <a href=#>Montecito mansion</a> following a recent court setback.</p><p>Kinsey Schofield, a <a href=#>royal</a> commentator based in LA, <a href=# rel=nofollow>spoke</a> to GB News America about the duke.</p><p>When asked if “Prince Harry is lonely in Montecito” in his mansion, Kinsey believes he is “yes, 100%”.</p><p>She said: “I have heard that he is lonely, yes. Even if without knowing what I know, you have to imagine that this is a young man that grew up in an all boys school, with a bunch of rambunctious guys. A lot of really deep, fun, silly, friendships they experience something normal people didn’t experience.”</p><p>Kinsey continued: “Then Christmas in a castle, where every film is filled with your cousins. That’s not the reality he has anymore. Today, he will wake up and celebrate a birthday with four people in the room.</p><p>“I do believe he is lonely, he aches for the world he left behind.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-harry-has-six-cases-in-court>Prince Harry has six cases in court</h2><p>The royal is currently involved in six ongoing court cases, four are against publishers, while two are against the Home Office in the UK.</p><p>The recent setback is regarding his case against The Mail on Sunday – which is part of the ongoing libel battle between Harry and the publisher. The Duke has taken Associated Newspapers LTD (ANL) to the High Court over a story published last year. The article was regarding his concerns over <a href=#>security arrangements</a> in place for him and his family when they visit Britain.</p><p>His lawyers tried to strike out part of the defense, alleging ANL had made out the 39-year-old had lied and tried to influence public opinion.</p><p>Prince Harry had claimed the story had brought ‘substantial hurt, embarrassment and distress which is continuing’. Whereas ANL argued, the story had no harm to the reputation to the royal, who is fifth in line to the throne.</p><p>The judge ruled the newspaper had a “real prospect of demonstrating that an honest person could have held that view that Harry’s PR team were “spinning” a story regarding the nature of security. ANL is arguing their article was honest opinion. In turn, the Duke has been ordered to pay ANL’s legal costs of $61,000 (£48,000). This sum will have to be paid by December 29.</p><p>However, the case is not over yet. The trial itself is ongoing, as this High Court ruling was simply part of the battle, with Harry’s lawyers arguing against a single part of the defense. The trial is expected to take place between the middle of May and the end of July 2024.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-duke-s-concerns-for-safety>Duke’s concerns for safety</h2><p>It comes after Harry is appealing a court decision connected to the Home Office’s decision regarding his security in the UK. His legal team are fighting a February 2020 decision which ruled the prince and his family wouldn’t receive the same level of personal protection when they visit his native land. This decision was made based on <a href=#>Meghan Markle and Harry</a> stepping down as senior members of The Firm that year. After the couple stepped back, they lived with <a href=#>billionaire Tyler Perry</a> for a while, before Prince Harry and Meghan found their Montecito mansion and forever home.</p><p>The dad-of-two is fighting the decision, which came from the Home Office’s Executive Committee for the Protection of Royalty and Public Figures.</p><p>His lawyers are claiming this decision was “irrational”, arguing the Duke was treated “less favorably” than others in similar positions. But Home Office counsel say the ‘Spare’ did not lose all of his security provisions. Instead, they say he must follow “bespoke” rules, which were put in place after the Prince Harry and Meg moved to their Montecito mansion.</p><p>In July last year, Judge Mr Justice Swift ruled the Duke’s case can proceed, with Harry’s claim to seek a judicial review granted. Following a three-day hearing in early December, his lawyers released an emotional statement from the Prince, who wasn’t present, instead Harry was at home.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-i-cannot-put-my-wife-in-danger-like-that>“I cannot put my wife in danger like that”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-1177044844-1024x725.jpg><p>“It was with great sadness for both of us that my wife and I felt forced to&nbsp;step back from this role&nbsp;and leave the country in 2020,” Harry said in the statement.</p><p>“The UK is my home. The UK is central to the heritage of my children and a place I want them to feel at home, as much as where they live at the moment in the United States.”</p><p>He added: “I cannot put my wife in danger like that and, given my experiences in life, I am reluctant to unnecessarily put myself in harm’s way too.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2aCcLzRoqWcnV2drrO%2B2GagrGWWmrKttc2gZKWnnpq5unnIp2ShoaNiurC6056aoqyfYrqiutKipqdlkah6p63MoqOyZZGnsm6uwJyiZqGeYsGpsYyuomadqKWys8CMrJiyq18%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./security-and-fire-safety-in-workplace.html>&#171;&nbsp;A Guide to Security and Fire Safety in Workplace</a>

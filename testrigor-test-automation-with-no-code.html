I’ve discovered ten thousand ways that don’t work.”</strong> – Thomas Edison</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Maestro of NoCode Automation Testing</h3><p>testRigor is known for its simplicity, innovation, and precise perfection. The company and its services project excellence, creativity, and expertise which is unmatched, earning them a highly respected and dominant position in the market. But all this would not be possible without an equally crafted and talented team of expert personnel, getting testRigor where it is today, and aiming ahead with no plan of stopping.</p><p><strong>“We help our employees to make a huge impact and empower them to achieve unprecedented results.” – Leadership at testRigor</strong></p><p>What brings the company, the team, the services, the benchmark standards, and everything together is the set of core values and leadership that the company’s foundation is built on. testRigor has a leader who believes in enabling and inspiring the team, who believes in carving perfection out of complexities, encompassing all traits and qualities of a true leader.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Artem Golubev is the Co-Founder and CEO of testRigor.</h3><p>Artem has been building business software for the last 25 years. The majority of his career went into working on business systems like ERPs, CRMs, Business Marketplaces, Banking Software, etc. targeting business customers and grew to appreciate the importance of the quality of large complex systems.</p><p><strong>“I believe we are in the business of helping our customers to deliver high-quality products and doing our best to make this process as easy and seamless as it is technically possible”, </strong>Artem adds.</p><p>Artem believes testRigor is an absolute game changer in software testing by introducing what is essentially common sense into end-to-end testing, which resulted in explosive growth over the last couple of years.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Artem’s views on constant vigilance as a need or a strategy?</h3><p>It is a business necessity. There are always several different things that go wrong and need to be addressed ASAP. It is a part of running any business, I believe.</p><p>However, I don’t think it can be called a “strategy” since it is rather a tactic. A strategy would be something like “Bullets, then Cannonballs”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>testRigor’s one of many successful client stories?</strong></h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Customer Overview</h3><p>For three decades, IDT Corporation has pioneered technologies and services that</p><p>enable people and businesses around the world to collaborate and share more</p><p>fluently and affordably. Today, IDT leverages its expertise to provide consumers and</p><p>businesses with innovative communications and payments services through their</p><p>flagship brands: IDT®, BOSS Revolution®, net2phone®, and National Retail</p><p>Solutions®.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The Problem</h3><p>IDT’s QA automation team was stuck at low test coverage. They had a goal of</p><p>reaching 90% test coverage. They spent 32 man-years of QA Engineering building automated tests. After that, they were not making any progress</p><p>towards their 90% automation goal and were stuck at around 34% automation</p><p>because all of their QA Engineers were 100% busy maintaining existing tests instead</p><p>of building new ones.&nbsp;</p><p>When it became clear that they were not building tests efficiently enough, IDT began</p><p>looking into other ways to build test automation. To find the right tool for the</p><p>challenge, they explored and tried out several tools for automated testing. IDT was</p><p>specifically looking for a tool that would let manual testers implement automation,</p><p>regardless of the level of programming skills. Furthermore, the test automation tool</p><p>had to be able to handle applications built with a wide range of frameworks like</p><p>Android, iOS, Angular, React, React Native, Flutter, etc. – again, without requiring</p><p>that testers have in-depth knowledge about these technologies.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What IDT Wanted:</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Less Maintenance</h3><p>IDT QA Engineers were stuck with test maintenance and couldn’t progress after</p><p>reaching 34% of test coverage.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Speed of Test Creation</h3><p>IDT needed a tool to build automation quickly because manual testing was taking up too much time and resources.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Key Objectives</h3><ul><li>Save on cost</li><li>Increase automated test coverage</li><li>Less test maintenance</li><li>Eliminate unexpected recurring bug</li><li>Work across a wide range of frameworks</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The Solution</h3><p>IDT’s manual QA team was able to get from 34% to 91% in under 9 months. testRigor</p><p>enabled IDT to empower their manual QA workforce to build automation. Moreover,</p><p>each manual QA was building twice as many tests as QA Engineers previously were,</p><p>while still performing their manual QA work. Most importantly, they spend less than</p><p>0.1% of their time on test maintenance with testRigor.</p><p>Instead of spending most of their time maintaining existing tests, they now spend a</p><p>majority of their time using testRigor to generate new tests. Overall, IDT has used</p><p>testRigor to speed up releases, increase test coverage, and enhance their team’s collaboration.</p><figure class=wp-block-table><table><tbody readability=4.5><tr><td><strong>Objective</strong></td><td><strong>Result</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Cost Saving</td><td>Minimum $576,000 Per Year</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>More Automated Test Coverage</td><td>91% Automated</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Less Test Maintenance</td><td>Less Than 0.1% Test Maintenance</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Elimination Of Unexpected Recurring Bugs</td><td>90% Reduction In Bugs</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqyr8DEq6eroaOaxLC%2By51lnKedZMGmv9OroKCnomLBpr%2FTZpiurJ%2BirrW1zqdksKGknXqvu4ycpp2d</p></div><div id=links><a href=./china-coronavirus-man-detained-after-meme-dog.html>&#171;&nbsp;Coronavirus: man detained after posting meme of dog wearing police hat to protest against Covid-19 r</a>

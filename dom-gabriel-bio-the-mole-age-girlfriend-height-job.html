Learn about his journey, his age, his girlfriend, and his job in this article below.</p><p>We attempt to cover it all here in this Dom Gabriel Bio.</p><h3><strong>Dom Gabriel On Netflix’s The Mole</strong></h3><p>The Mole on Netflix is nothing short of captivating as it serves as a revival of the ABC original cult classic competition series of the same name, which is itself based on the Belgian production “De Mol.” After all, it revolves around 12 players—actually, 11 plus a saboteur—as they go through a variety of tasks in an effort to find the traitor among them in order to win the prize pool.</p><p>One of them was the incredibly sincere Dom Gabriel, but he regrettably was ousted in episode 4. As a result, here is what we know about him at this time and where he stands in the competition.</p><p>If we’re being completely honest, Dom wasn’t just playing a straight game; he also made swift, close, and genuine contacts, which allowed him to quickly position himself as one of the most genuine candidates.</p><p>His plan was to invest as much money as possible as rapidly as possible, while also carefully developing partnerships in an effort to identify potential moles through direct, trustworthy teamwork. Although he is 6’4″, heavily tattooed, and certainly competitive, the truth is that he could have easily taken on the unfriendly persona.</p><p>However, his soft personality just won out.</p><p>Being raised by a single mother, Dom wants to win the show for her. Because of this, he tried his luck when offered the chance to enter the competition again right after being eliminated. However, he was unsuccessful, and he was sent home with only the experience.</p><p>In the show, Dom competed against Casey Lary, Avori Henderson, Greg Shapiro, Jacob Hacker, Joi Schweitzer, Kesi Neblett, Osei White, Pranav Patel, Samara Joy, Sandy Ronquillo, and William Richardson.</p><h3><strong>Dom Gabriel Age</strong></h3><p>As of 2022, at the time of the premiere of the show, Dom Gabriel was 29 years old.</p><h3><strong>Does Dom Gabriel Have A Girlfriend?</strong></h3><p>Dom Gabriel is tall and without a doubt a very handsome man. So it might come as a surprise to announce that he is likely single, or at least in the public eyes. He seems pretty reserved about his dating life but all that we can say for now is that he appears single currently in 2022, according to his social media posts.</p><h3><strong>Dom Gabriel Job</strong></h3><p>Netflix reported that Dom Gabriel has a job working as a heavy machinery operator at Ben and Jerry’s Ice Cream factory. In the company, he hauls heavy loads of ice cream all day long. Dom is required to dress entirely in cold clothing, maintain the factory at subfreezing temperatures, and take 20-minute breaks in order to be safe. He is prepared to exit the freezer and enter the outback of Australia.</p><p>Per his IG, Dom is also a fashion model and has posed for several photographers. Moreover, he is also pursuing a music career under the moniker DØNTCALL (<a href=#>@dontcallband</a>). He has released a song titled Drunk Texts & Misscalls. You can also find his music on <a href=#>Spotify</a> and <a href=#>Spotify</a>.</p><p>Moreover, Dom is also a passionate boxer as well as a lyrical dancer.</p><p>Talking about his education, Dominique attended the University of Guelph from 2011 to 2015. He was an Extended Practice Monitor while at the university.</p><h3><strong>Dom Gabriel Height</strong></h3><p>According to his bio, Dom Gabriel stands tall at a towering height of 6 feet 3 inches.</p><h3><strong>Where Is Dom Gabriel From?</strong></h3><p>Dominique Gabriel is currently residing in Toronto, Ontario.

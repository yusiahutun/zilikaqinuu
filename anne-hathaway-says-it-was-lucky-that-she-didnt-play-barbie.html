However, they eventually lost the rights after nothing materialized. Now, Anne has praised <a href=#>Margot Robbie</a> and Greta Gerwig’s box-office hit.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-1407563276-682x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-anne-hathaway-almost-played-barbie>Anne Hathaway almost played Barbie</h2><p>In the interview, the <a href=#>Hollywood</a> actress said it was “lucky” her version of Barbie was never made and she called Margot’s interpretation of the toy “sublime.” A nod to <a href=#>Ryan Gosling’s</a> iconic line? We think so!</p><p>The 41-year-old said: “What’s so exciting about what Greta and Margot and that phenomenal team [did] is they hit a bullseye. The bullseye caused the entire world to reach this level of ecstasy. Now imagine that version … that much energy, that much anticipation, that much emotion … but it’s not the right version.</p><p>“I actually think of it as a lucky thing [it didn’t get made].”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Golden Globes 2024: The Barbenheimer battle isn’t over yet</a></p><p>“Margot is sublime,” the <a href=#>movie</a> star continued. “What she is doing as a creative person and a producer is so exciting and inspiring. The mythic giants they toppled with [‘Barbie’] that have kept certain narratives in place that have not allowed opportunities to develop for so many people … they ran straight through it! Just as a cinema-goer and as a woman in Hollywood since I was a kid, I’m thrilled by the development.”</p><p>“If I believed that the version I was attached to could have done that, I might feel differently about it, but I genuinely think their film was the best possible version,” the <a href=#>celebrity</a> said.</p><p>“It’s easy just to be thrilled and happy [for them]. I love watching women kill it. To do so well, so undeniably that they actually had to write new records … come on! I think it will probably make things better.”</p><p><a href=#>Anne Hathaway</a>‘s Barbie would have seen the character be banished from Barbieland after being deemed imperfect, and her following adventure. The script was written by comedian Amy Schumer. However, after joining the project in 2016, the celebrity suddenly left, but said that her original reason wasn’t actually the real one for leaving.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-amy-schumer-left-barbie-after-conflicts-with-the-studio>Amy Schumer left Barbie after conflicts with the studio</h2><p>Amy explained in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter last year the actual reason she walked away was because she and the studio didn’t agree on Barbie’s direction. The comedian said she wrote Barbie, who was supposed to be played by Anne Hathaway, as an inventor, but that the studio wanted her to specially invent a pair of Jell-O shoes.</p><p>“They definitely didn’t want to do it the way I wanted to do it, the only way I was interested in doing it,” she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p><p>It further put her off that Sony sent her a pair of Manolo Blahniks heels to celebrate the film’s development.</p><p>“The idea that that’s just what every woman must want, right there, I should have gone, ‘You’ve got the wrong gal.'”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-margot-robbie-says-she-struggled-to-prepare-for-barbie>Margot Robbie says she struggled to prepare for Barbie</h2><p>While participating in this year’s Actors on Actors opposite Oppenheimer’s Cillian Murphy, the 33-year-old opened up about playing the character.</p><p>Margot said her usual “psychopath” methods to prepare to star as the iconic doll <a href=#>“didn’t work.”</a></p><p>“All my usual tools didn’t apply for this character,” the Suicide Squad star explained.</p><p>“I work with an acting coach, and I work with a dialect coach, and I work with a movement coach, and I read everything, and I watch all the things. I rely on animal work a lot.”</p><p>Margot continued: “I was maybe 45 minutes into pretending to be a flamingo or whatever, and I was suddenly like, “It’s not working.”</p><p>She then explained she used inspiration from a woman who had no inner voice. She added a person who “kind of thinks about exactly what’s in front of her – a spotlight to what exactly is in front of her at the time” when playing <a href=#>Barbie</a>.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Meryl Streep almost never got Devil Wears Prada role after brutal comment</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2Z%2FcK3Np5xmoJGptaLDwLJkrJmpqHqqwIywmKxlnKqwrMWMrZ%2BarF2otaZ5w6Kbp6xdpbmixYybmKuamZp8</p></div><div id=links><a href=./dorian-harewood-wife-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Dorian Harewood Bio, Age, Net Worth 2022, Salary, Wife, Height, Movies</a>

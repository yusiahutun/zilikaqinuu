However, few are aware of the eerie origins of this famous character. Created in 1928 by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks, Mickey Mouse's first appearance in "Steamboat Willie" was far from the cheerful image we know today.

Despite being removed shortly after the attraction's opening, eerie sightings and unexplained phenomena have led many to believe that the Hatbox Ghost's spirit still lingers within the mansion's walls.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-3>The Sinister Side of Snow White</h2><p>"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" is a classic Disney film cherished by audiences of all ages. However, lurking beneath its charming facade is a dark and sinister fact.

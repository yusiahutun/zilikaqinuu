The Scandi lifestyle (hygge, lagom, their interiors reputation) helped to increase our fascination with their culture as a whole, while their approach to minimalist, more comfortable and laidback dressing perfectly complemented what was happening on the catwalk.</p><img alt="Street Style - September 2016 New York Fashion Week - Day 4" title="Street Style - September 2016 New York Fashion Week - Day 4" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/pernille-teisbaek-wears-a-green-floral-dress-a-loewe-bag-news-photo-1577173553.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Melodie Jeng</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“You can obviously find cool and stylish people everywhere, but it’s not just a matter of style, it is about how confident these women are,” <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/fashion-news/a23103090/ganni-founders-interview-ditte-nicolaj-reffstrup/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Nicolaj Reffstrup, CEO of Ganni, one of Denmark’s most successful fashion labels, told us" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Nicolaj Reffstrup, CEO of Ganni, one of Denmark’s most successful fashion labels, told us</a>. “This comes back to living in a society that is balanced, convenient and less stressful than most other places in the world.

Theories as to why it was so popular, and therefore stuck around for so long, run from childhood nostalgia to its soothing qualities and even that it was a reaction to gender fluidity.</p><img alt="Valentino : Runway - Paris Fashion Week Womenswear Fall/Winter 2018/2019" title="Valentino : Runway - Paris Fashion Week Womenswear Fall/Winter 2018/2019" width=3023 height=4534 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/model-walks-the-runway-during-the-valentino-show-as-part-of-news-photo-1577173790.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Pascal Le Segretain</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Valentino autumn/winter 2018</p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">‘90s nostalgia</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Bum bags, slip dresses, chokers, tiny sunglasses, scrunchies – the 2010s was influenced by the 1990s more than any other time period. In terms of trends, the catwalk harked back to the era time and time again, while some of the biggest talking points in fashion came from ‘90s nostalgia too – take the supermodel tribute to Gianni Versace or the A-list’s new penchant for finding vintage ‘90s pieces for the red carpet (Kim Kardashian West we’re looking at you).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Of course, nostalgic fashion is nothing new – there is a theory that everything in pop culture operates on a ‘nostalgia pendulum’, where what is old finds itself as a hot new trend again about 20 to 30 years later (primarily dictated by the average age of the designers who are leading said trends and feeling nostalgic about their childhoods) - so a ‘90s comeback was not entirely unexpected.</p><img alt="Celebrity Sightings In New York City - October 10, 2019" title="Celebrity Sightings In New York City - October 10, 2019" width=2528 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bella-hadid-arrives-at-lavenue-for-her-23rd-birthday-party-news-photo-1577173918.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Gotham</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Many designers revisited their roots or perhaps even what had been their inspiration in going into fashion in the first place, while consumers embraced fond pieces that were once in their wardrobe, just as is so often the case each decade. However, the impact of nostalgia on what was such a transformative decade for the world meant that is had a far more significant role to play.

However, the change in mindset really only came within the last decade, first starting out as just another trend, but resulting in perhaps the most significant fashion shift we have seen in dressing in recent history.</p><img alt="The Duke And Duchess Of Cambridge Take Part In The King's Cup Regatta" title="The Duke And Duchess Of Cambridge Take Part In The King's Cup Regatta" width=1372 height=2120 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/catherine-duchess-of-cambridge-arrives-at-the-royal-yacht-news-photo-1577174079.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Antony Jones</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Of course, the first memorable moment that signalled change was when Céline’s then creative director Phoebe Philo took her bow during Paris Fashion Week in 2011, wearing a pair of Adidas Stan Smith trainers. Numerous milestones followed – Victoria Beckham swapping her trademark heels for a pair of box-fresh white trainers, Kate and Meghan making them a permanent part of their famously formal royal wardrobes, retailers seeing buzzy sneakers become the new It-bags, and trainers overtaking heels as the most sold shoe in the UK (according to Mintel in 2016).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">One reason that trainers stuck around as much more than a passing trend can of course be linked with the changing place of women in society, where there is less desire to dress for men and instead to put comfort and practicality first, but the movement also nicely coincided with another of the biggest fashion trends of the decade, sports luxe. Which leads us nicely on to...</p><img alt="Celine: Runway - Paris Fashion Week Fall/Winter 2012" title="Celine: Runway - Paris Fashion Week Fall/Winter 2012" width=3296 height=2348 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/phoebe-philo-walks-the-runway-during-the-celine-ready-to-news-photo-1577174119.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Michel Dufour</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=39 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Sports luxe</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">From cycling shorts to sports bras, tracksuits to trainers, the 2010s saw a drive towards fashionable, high-end sportswear, quickly becoming one of the most significant trends of the decade. Athleisure and sports luxe certainly benefitted from the broader wellness movement that took hold, but these were clothes that might be designed to look as if you are on your way to the gym, but would never actually be worn to sweat in. And, although fashion has had its sporty moments in the past, never had this idea of dressing down been so impactful as it was for this decade.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While long-established designers and high-street stores got hooked on the trend (leggings on the Chanel catwalk, tracksuits at Chloé, Alexander Wang’s crop tops, Balenciaga’s hoodies), new brands were founded on the concept too, including Beyoncé’s Ivy Park, Virgil Abloh’s Off-White, Rihanna’s Puma x Fenty, Kanye West’s Yeezy line and Demna Gvasalia’s Vetements. Designers teamed up with traditional sportswear brands too – Stella McCartney and Prada with Adidas, Commes des Garçons with Nike and Roksanda with Lululemon. Sportswear went and remained dramatically luxurious.</p><img alt="Celebrity Sightings In Los Angeles - August 11, 2015" title="Celebrity Sightings In Los Angeles - August 11, 2015" width=2168 height=3099 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/kendall-jenner-is-seen-on-august-11-2015-in-los-angeles-news-photo-1577174189.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Bauer-Griffin</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Midway through the decade and everyone from celebrities to fashion editors had fully embraced this casual way of dressing, everywhere from the airport to the office - and albeit it often with a full face of immaculate make-up and a sleek blow-dry (the polish has to come from somewhere) - but how will the trend fare in the new decade? Although sports luxe has shown few signs of abating, the last few seasons have seen a move towards more ladylike and sophisticated dressing, suggesting that in the new ‘20s, we might choose to start dressing up again.</p><img alt="Chloe : Runway - Paris Fashion Week Womenswear Spring/Summer 2016" title="Chloe : Runway - Paris Fashion Week Womenswear Spring/Summer 2016" width=2833 height=4256 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/edie-campbell-walks-the-runway-during-the-chloe-ready-to-news-photo-1577174279.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Victor VIRGILE</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Chloe spring/summer 2016</p><h2 data-node-id=45 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">The rise and fall of the skinny jean</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=46 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When it came to denim, skinny jeans seemed like the trend that would never die, until it finally did. Ever since the mid noughties when they were championed by the likes of Kate Moss, skinny jeans became a mainstay in most women’s wardrobes, regardless of age or body shape. Worn by everyone from young pop stars to members of the royal family, the style dominated the market, with sales of skintight jeans remaining the most popular fit for most shoppers. Take, for example, Topshop, which was selling 20,000 pairs of its skinny Baxter style each week in the mid noughties and into this decade.</p><img alt="The Duchess Of Cambridge Attends A Sportaid Athlete Workshop" title="The Duchess Of Cambridge Attends A Sportaid Athlete Workshop" width=1693 height=2953 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/catherine-duchess-of-cambridge-leaves-the-copper-box-arena-news-photo-1577174422.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Max Mumby/Indigo</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=48 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It is not straightforward to explain how skinny jeans remained such a popular style for such a long period of time, particularly because they are also widely thought to be quite an unflattering or unforgiving style, but they somehow entered our wardrobes and refused to fall out of favour.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=49 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">However, nearly 20 years after they first became fashionable, by the end of 2018, the style had finally had its heyday, and we switched the stretchy, tight style for something straighter, looser and higher on the waist. According to global fashion search engine Lyst, searches for ‘Mom’ style jeans overtook skinny jeans in 2019, with shoppers finally embracing a new look.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=50 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But, having been such a dominant wardrobe staple over such a long period of time, there is every chance that we haven’t seen the last of the skinny style.

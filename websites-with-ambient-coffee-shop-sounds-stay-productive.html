In fact, a moderate level of what can be considered as "noise" can actually enhance your ability to think creatively because your brain works harder to overcome the surrounding distractions.</p><p>Whether you’re a coffee lover or simply looking for a change in atmosphere, cafes have been a popular choice for all kinds of workers to get focused and productive. Here are&nbsp;six websites that bring the coffee shop to you.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=1-i-miss-my-cafe>1.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I Miss My Cafe</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/i-miss-my-cafe-audio-blending.png><p>If you want to fine-tune and recreate the atmosphere of your favorite cafe, look no further. I Miss My Cafe is one of the most aesthetically made websites on the internet for coffee shop sounds. It will be an absolute standout if you also value having something visually pleasing to look at. The homepage is well-designed and simplistic, featuring a line illustration and clean fonts.</p><p>One of the key features of I Miss My Cafe is its ability to let you customize your perfect blend of sounds that are specific to a cafe. From the recordings of a barista speaking to customers to even the specific volume of the cups and machinery, you can toggle multiple unique sounds and adjust their volumes to your liking.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>This makes&nbsp;this site a great choice if you’re particular about your sound environment and would like full control and customization. You can even adjust the way your sounds pan from the left to the right ear.</p><p>This is also a great website to go to if you’re a music lover who enjoys listening to the playlist of your local cafe. They also feature a Spotify playlist to enhance the experience, although you will only be able to listen to 30-second previews if you are not signed in to Spotify. In all, this is the best website to customize a pure cafe experience.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=2-coffivity>2.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Coffivity</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/coffivity-homepage.png><p>If you are looking for specially made and pre-blended sounds for your virtual cafe experience, look no further than Coffivity. While there is a premium tier that offers twice as many sounds (with special location themes), the free sounds offered will be more than enough for the average worker. As far as control goes, you are limited to being able to adjust the volume, or simply pausing and starting the sounds.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>How to Use Coffitivity to Create a Productive Workplace</a></span></p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>They offer Morning Murmur, Lunchtime Lounge, and University Undertones for free, each with different levels of patron chatter and energy. However, you can opt for premium access with $9 for a whole year, which gives you access to three more premium soundscapes that will take you to cafes around the world.</p><p>Coffivity is also a great website to take a look at if you want additional productivity resources aside from simply the coffee shop sounds. This is the best place to go for a variety of pre-blended audio atmospheres, while still remaining simple and user-friendly.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=3-hipstersound>3.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hipstersound</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hipstersound-homepage.png><p>Hipstersound is another beautifully designed website that brings you a selection of different cafes to tune in to. It is also the site on our list with the most additional features that you can use to maximize your sound experience.</p><p>Similar to Coffivity, this website operates on a freemium basis. You get access to three public demo sounds, which are Buzz of a Busy Texas Cafe, Les Charmant Cafés des Paris, and Gentle Hum of a Quiet Restaurant.</p><p>You&nbsp;can also fine-tune your audio blend with additional sound effects that differ depending on the demo you pick. Some unique atmospheres you can simulate include jazz bars, guitar bands, a French companion, and more.</p><p>Lastly,&nbsp;can set a timer&nbsp;to mute the audio in either one hour or 30 minutes. This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;useful reminder for how long you’ve been working and can help you block out your breaks.</p><p>If you want to unlock all their premium features you’ll need to&nbsp;subscribe for either $24 for one-year access, or $29 for 2-year access. These are not auto-renewing subscriptions. Joining premium&nbsp;gives you five additional Cafe soundscapes from Hipstersound, as well as access to premium nature and positivity soundscapes from Asmrion and Rainbowhunt.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=4-rainy-cafe>4.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rainy Cafe</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/rainy-cafe-homepage.png><p>If simplicity is what you’re looking for, then it doesn’t get simpler than Rainy Cafe. On this website, you only get two sounds to toggle on and off: the Cafe and the Rain.</p><p>While you can adjust the volumes for both of these sounds, there is no&nbsp;other customization and what you see is what you get. As a bonus, it means that you can also listen exclusively to the rain (moderate thunder effects included).</p><p>This is perfect if you don’t want choices. Because it’s straight to the point, you don’t have to decide between different cafe environments or worry about blending your sound components to perfection. Simply turn on the sound and get straight to work.</p><h2 id=5-cafe-restaurant>5.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cafe Restaurant</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cafe-restaurant-audio-blending.png><p>Cafe Restaurant is one portion of a website known as myNoise. In this space, you have the ability to create your own coffee shop audio mix by controlling the audio levels of various sounds. While you’ll be able to create your own cafe, you can also simulate any type of eatery with additional restaurant and kitchen sounds.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>How to Create Binaural Beats on MyNoise</a></span></p><p>Also, you can implement a meditation bell that can go off in different time intervals, set up timers for productivity, and save your mixes. The sidebar also comes with preset sounds for different atmospheres, such as Cafeteria or a Table for One.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>This is a great site if you want to go beyond cafe sounds to also enjoy additional soundscapes of patron chatter. It’s also perfect if you want the ability to control and save your audio mixes.</p><h2 id=6-lifeat>6.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LifeAt</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/lifeat-cafe-videostream-from-tokyo.png><p>This website takes the virtual cafe experience to the next level. Not only does it provide you with the ambient sounds of working at a cafe, but you will feel like you’re sitting at a table enjoying a cup of coffee with your work.</p><p>LifeAt provides you with a video feed of workspace locations around the world, and they have a special category just for cafes. You can shuffle your cafe scenery and save your favorite locations in a playlist.</p><p>There is limited control&nbsp;over the soundscape&nbsp;as you can only adjust the volume. But&nbsp;the unique experience of being able to see the cafe makes up for it. The sidebar also includes a built-in <a href=#>Pomodoro timer</a>, but the settings are locked at 25-minute work blocks. You can also find a lo-fi Spotify playlist, although you will once again need to sign in for the full-length songs.</p><p>If you have a second monitor or any other way to view the live stream unobstructed, this is a unique productivity experience to try out.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=time-to-get-productive>Time to Get Productive</h2><p>Now that you’ve found your new go-to destination for perfectly blended coffee shop soundscapes, it’s time to get to work. Whether you’re opting for the simple one-and-done of Rainy Cafe, or want to be your own remixer on (Restaurant), you can find yourself experiencing higher levels of productivity with the help of these background sounds.</p><p>So get a nice cup of coffee for yourself, tune into your new favorite soundscape, and let yourself get productive.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiunpqjnsGmv4ywoK2gXZa6o7XEp6tmm5%2Bbs6axjKyfqKhdqLy2usOsZKyska56sb7OnaycrJmrsnA%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./fashwire-fashion-with-consumer-insights.html>&#171;&nbsp;FashWire - Fashion with consumer insights | Kimberly Carney</a>

Parker Stevenson and Kirstie Alley are not Lillie Price’s biological parents</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/33c7d0e42418bf4e.jpg><p class=align-left>Lillie’s parents, Parker and Kirstie, tried to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">conceive a child</a> for several years. Finally, in 1990, their wish came true when she got pregnant. That resulted in Kirstie spending $23,000 on maternity clothes, baby clothes, and nursery decorating.</p><p class=align-left>Her jubilance turned into tragedy when she suffered a miscarriage eight weeks into the pregnancy. Devastated, Kirstie and Parker adopted their son William True Stevenson. William was born on 5 October 1992 (age 29), one week after his birth. Then, in 1995, Kirstie and Parker adopted daughter Lillie, a year after she was born.</p><p class=align-left>Since Kirstie and Parker adopted their children, that makes William True and Lillie Price Stevenson stepsiblings and the stepchildren of Kirstie Alley and Parker Stevenson.</p><h3>3.

Unfortunately, the couple divorced in 1997 after <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">14 years of marriage</a>. Their divorce became the talk of the tabloids when Parker sued Alley for spousal support.</p><p class=align-left>Stevenson claimed that he wanted spousal support because of the lavish lifestyle with Kirstie, including multiple residences with a full-time staff of housekeepers, chefs, nannies, and exotic animals for pets. Furthermore, he wanted Alley to pay $18,000 per month to pay rent on a home in Bel Air and more compensation.</p><p class=align-left>The actor also detailed that his earnings were only a fraction of what Alley earned.

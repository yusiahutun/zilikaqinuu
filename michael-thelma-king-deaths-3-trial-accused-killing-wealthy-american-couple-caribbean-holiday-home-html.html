'We weren't able to reach them on Thursday. We called all day on Thursday. The fact that he didn't call made me a little suspicious, but not a lot.'<br></span></p><p><span>Mr Daboul said he drove over to the King's home at the Ocean Club Resort in Cupecoy on Friday, September 21, and banged on the door.<br></span></p><p><span>He said he asked a person who had been on the premises at the time to climb over a fence and see if they saw anyone in the house. Mr Daboul said the person told him that he saw a dead man leaning over a chair.<br></span></p><p><span>Following the murders, the island's hospitality and trade association released a statement expressing outrage at the attack and offering condolences to friends and family of the couple.<br></span></p><p><span>'St. Maarten is a small, diverse and close knit community.

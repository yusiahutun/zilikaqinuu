But typical desktop computers, <a href=#>routers</a>, and similar devices still need to be plugged into a power source all the time to work.</p><p>That's where an <a href=#>uninterruptible power supply (UPS) comes in</a>. Its main function is to act as a big battery that <a href=#>powers your devices</a> when your electricity goes out. They range from small units that can sustain a few low-power devices to big house units for entire homes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Battery capacity (usually denoted by the power rating in watts) should be the number one focus when getting a UPS. A sub-1000W UPS should be good enough for most appliances, but if you have really powerful systems like a gaming rig, you might want to look beyond the 1000W mark.</p><p>Once you've sorted the capacity, you need to evaluate the devices you'd be connecting to the UPS, specifically their sensitivity to signal fluctuations. Sensitive equipment like some newer <a href=#>LED TVs</a>, CFL light bulbs, and audio equipment perform best on a pure sine wave. In this case, you'd need a UPS with a pure sine wave output. However, most other devices, including laptop computers, cell phone chargers, and any equipment that uses an AC/DC adapter, will usually work fine with a modified sine wave output.</p><p>You should also consider the UPS's ability to protect your appliances. Most options come with built-in surge protection, so you can rest assured that sudden jolts of electricity won't phase your connected devices.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But just as important is the presence of automatic voltage regulation (AVR) to keep your devices safe from minor power fluctuations throughout the day. The absence of AVR does not necessarily spell doom for your devices, but your UPS will have to kick in battery power more often, resulting in faster wear.</p><p>Size is another factor to consider when getting a UPS. More often than not, a higher capacity will translate to a bigger device. But factors like outlets and the presence of additional technologies play a role. That said, a larger device does not necessarily equal more ports.</p><p>With these factors in mind, here are our favorite UPSs for every price point and use case.</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><td colspan=3 style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p><strong>How Did We Research</strong></p></td></tr><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>Models Evaluated</p></td><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>Hours Researched</p></td><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>Reviews Analyzed</p></td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>13</p></td><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>7</p></td><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>9</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>How-To Geek's product recommendations come from the same team of experts that have helped people fix their gadgets over one billion times.

And it's no surprise considering it made our <a href=#>best surge protector picks</a>. At 1500VA/865W, it can power most of your devices, including computers, external hard drives, and wireless routers, from a few minutes to several hours, depending on the total connected load. This should give you enough time to wrap up what you're doing, save your work, and shut down your computer gracefully.</p><p>The device has an automatic voltage regulator (AVR) to protect the battery from power fluctuations. It also has a built-in surge protector to safeguard your connected devices from abnormal jolts of electricity.</p><p>In terms of size, the APC BR1500G Backup Battery is pretty large. It has five battery backup and surge-protected outlets and another set of five outlets with only surge protection making ten in total. However, there are no USB ports to plug in your phone directly.</p><p>There's also a small backlit LCD that shows plenty of information at a glance.

But the CyberPower PR1500LCD is not just a beast in raw power. It provides a true sine wave output as you'd get from the power grid, making it great for sensitive gear. There's also support for AVR, which protects your gear from minor fluctuations without having to call in the battery power.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The downside of this is how much all of this makes the unit costs. It'll set you back more than $500, making it far more expensive than any other option on this list. But if you can look past that, you'll quickly find it's worth the cost.</p><p>As with most UPS battery backups, more power comes a larger footprint, and the CyberPower PR1500LCD is no exception. When stood up, it's more than 1.5 times the width of our <a href=#>best overall recommendation</a>, which is not small in and of itself.</p><p>But if it's any consolation, the size has been put to good use, with a handy LCD control panel for monitoring its status. Plus, with the bundled <a href=#>Power Panel Business Edition</a> software, you can easily monitor all the minutiae of the UPS from afar using only a web browser.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> <img data-field=badge-image src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpressstatic0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-howtogeek-best_of-generic.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h5 class=display-card-title>CyberPower PR1500LCD UPS SystemCyberPower PR1500LCD UPS System</h5><span>Best UPS for Gaming</span><p class=display-card-description>The large 1500W capacity makes it perfect for high-power draw equipment like gaming systems.

Meanwhile, the lifespan of a typical UPS is about three to five years, depending on how well it's taken care of.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3>Are UPSes dangerous?</h3><p>Nowadays, UPS batteries are equipped with safety precautions that help to protect it from shorts or battery exposure, so while it's unlikely something will go wrong, you're still dealing with a massive supply of power. If something like the input transformer---which isolates the batteries from the ground reference and prevents voltage from traveling between the DC bus---were removed, there's a chance that a short will occur and carry the current's flow through any conductive material it touches, including humans, which could lead to serious injury or death. You also have to ensure you take good care of the UPS and keep it in a cool, dry environment to prevent accelerated aging which could cause the batteries to leak or explode over time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3>How does a UPS work?</h3><p>A UPS's job is to provide power to the devices connected to it if a primary power source is cut off or the voltage reaches extremely low levels. Primarily designed for things like PCs and network systems, it's basically a huge battery that works as a middle ground between standard AC power and a generator. While no UPS is big enough to keep your electronics on for days at a time, it will be enough for at least a couple hours until either your generator kicks in or you can safely shut down the electronics attached to it.</p><h3>Is a UPS useful for blackouts?</h3><p>A UPS is great if you're looking to protect your electronics from blackouts. If you experience one, the UPS will give you plenty of time to save work on your PC or finish projects on other connected devices before shutting them down.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhvam9mZYRwrsSsq2atoKh6o63TrZyrsV2XrqS31Klm</p></div><div id=links><a href=./tyler-reddick-wife.html>&#171;&nbsp;Tyler Reddick Wife, Children, Parents, Ethnicity, Wiki, Age, Biography, Net Worth</a>

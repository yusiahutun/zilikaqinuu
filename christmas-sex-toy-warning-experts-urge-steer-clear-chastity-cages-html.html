dizzying array of sex toys available online from ones that cost just over £1 to high-tech devices that can cost over £2,000.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But Ms Evans warned that there were plenty out there to avoid.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘There’s a lot of products out there that do more harm than good,’ she said.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She said one of the first things to consider was material, with latex, rubber and 'jelly' toys not recommended as they could be unhygienic and contain nasty chemicals.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘They are highly porous materials so they will actually absorb bacteria,’ she said.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘They also leech out chemicals and also degrade over time and will do so with some sexual lubricants.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ms Evans said another general rule to follow was price, with it sometimes being a case of getting what you pay for in terms of quality and safety.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Buyers should also&nbsp;<span style=font-size:16px>look at how responsive a seller was to questions or advice, with more reputable sellers being happy to give prompt and detailed advice to people curious about the toys they have in offer, she said.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ms Evans added that one neglected aspect of sex toy usage once you actually get one, is what lubricants to use.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She recommended using a high quality one as there's no point getting a expensive sex toy and damaging it with a cheap or inappropriate lubricant.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>And she urged Britons to avoid using food based oils from the kitchen cupboard.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Put in on your salad and not inside your vagina,’ she said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She also advised against using a DIY sex toy with a household item, listing mobile phones, hairbrushes, fruit and vegetables, and elastic bands as constriction devices, as some of the objects people have tired.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘People just assume you can use anything,’ she said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘You might end up with a trip to A&E and they’re a bit busy at the moment'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ms Johnson added that said people buying sexual toys online should avoid sellers that don't say what the material the toy is made of, don't buy second hand, and start small.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Sometimes people jump to the most expensive and or complicated toy that may be available,' she said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'It’s good to work with a consultant on selecting a toy that starts where you are in your exploration so that way you have time and space to grow and don’t introduce something that may be complex or intimidating.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ms Johnson said there was some space for DIY sex toys, provided they were safe to use for the intended purpose.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'An example that comes to mind is using a spatula for a spanking tool,' she said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'This can be as fun and effective as any purchased impact tool. The key remains that safety and durability of the item is always assessed before use.'</p>&lt;!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/gb/health/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -><span class=mol-ads-label-container><span class=mol-ads-label>Advertisement</span></span><p class=mol-para-with-font>Dildos and butt plugs are some of the most familiar sex toys.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But poorly-designed ones, lacking safety features designed to prevent them getting lost or stuck inside, can result in agony instead of ecstasy.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Hundreds of Britons need to be rushed to A&E each year for an emergency extraction every year.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The reason they pursue such an insertion in the first place is partly to do with the number of nerves in the anus that make it highly sensitive.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The act can also stimulate the prostate in men, an erogenous part of the male reproductive system.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>And for women, it can also indirectly stimulate parts of the vagina.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But the practise can cause damage if done incorrectly, resulting in tearing and bleeding of anus, incontinence, and potentially perforating the bowel.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The latter, while rare, can be deadly as material from the digestive tract spills into other parts of the body, causing an infection.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Some medical case reports have detailed such injuries being caused by 77cm sex toys used in combination with alcohol.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>NHS sexual health experts recommend people interested in anal stimulation use small toys at first, deploy plenty of lubrication, and ensure they only use a toy with a flared base.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The latter is key to avoiding an embarrassing trip to hospital, with the wider base of the sex toy stopping the item from getting 'lost' or stuck inside.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>One object experts definitely don't recommend inserting into yourself is the 'Bundle of Joy', a silicone sex toy shaped like a newborn baby, that is roughly two-and-a-half soft drink cans in size.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The 'male pregnancy' simulator, that sells for about £60 online, is designed to be shoved inside a man's rectum, who then proceeds to 'birth' the toy.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It is described online as 'a therapeutic means for anyone to simulate this most natural, wholesome, life-affirming event'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The creators, who list it as a sex toy, said the inspiration behind it was 'to allow any person, regardless of gender, an opportunity to experience to some degree the miracle of childbirth'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Samantha Evans, a former nurse who founded sex toy business Jo Divine and who also advises the NHS on sex toys, said something like the 'Bundle of Joy' was unsafe as there was nothing to stop it getting stuck.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘If you’re going to use an anal toy it really needs to have a flared base,’ she said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘We wouldn’t really recommend anything other than using a toy with a flared base.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She said there are many risks with using the wrong toy for anal play, ranging from tearing tissues to causing bleeding.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘There’s a huge potential for damage,’ she said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In addition to only using sex toys with a flared base for anal pleasure, Ms Evans also recommended people use plenty of an appropriate lubrication.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Jasmine Johnson, lead psychotherapist at Blue Pearl Therapy and adult film creator, also advised people to use toys with flanges, a protective rim stopping them from getting lost inside, similar to a flared base.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Simply put, toys will work their way up the rectum as a natural reaction to stimulation; so the flanges help avoid a stressful situation of a toy getting stuck in an unwanted position or unwanted period of time,' she said.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Another sex toy that experts have urged Britons to avoid is the use of metal constriction devices on their penises.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The devices include metal penis rings, which sold for as little as £3 online, and constrict the flesh around the penis.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>This traps blood in the genitals to make the organ slightly larger by the associated swelling or to last longer during sex.&nbsp;</p><img id=i-dc3750e5b8f1b950 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/12/07/10/65332821-11511617-image-a-4_1670408784371.jpg height=329 width=634 alt="Experts warned that metal chastity cages carried some of the same risks as metallic penis rings, being difficult to remove in an emergency" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Experts warned that metal chastity cages carried some of the same risks as metallic penis rings, being difficult to remove in an emergency</p><img id=i-bf224ff410d7d25c src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/12/19/10/65332823-11511617-Other_risks_of_the_devices_available_for_about_40_on_online_reta-a-1_1671444687493.jpg height=347 width=634 alt="Other risks of the devices, available for about £40 on online retailer Etsy, include can cause direct trauma to the penis due to their intentionally tight confines" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Other risks of the devices, available for about £40 on online retailer Etsy, include can cause direct trauma to the penis due to their intentionally tight confines&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Another similar device is chastity cages, which sell for about £40 online, and which encase a flaccid penis in a moulded metal prison fastened with a lock.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In contrast to penis rings, chastity cages are designed to prevent erections due to their tight confines, and additionally are intended to be worn for long periods.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Fans find this pain pleasurable as an aspect of BDSM (bondage, domination, sadism and masochism).&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But both devices don't come without risk. They can get stuck — effectively strangling the penis.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Apart from an embarrassing trip to A&E, this can also cause parts penis tissue to die from a lack of oxygen.

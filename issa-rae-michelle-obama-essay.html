Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Gloria Steinem, Tracee Ellis Ross, Lena Dunham, Jason Wu and Cecile Richards are just a few who authored pieces on the former FLOTUS. Below, actress, director and Insecure creator Issa Rae opens up about how Michelle Obama impacted her life and hit TV show.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 2012, I collaborated on a parody video of Michelle Obama to “expose” what was really going on in her head. It started with putting ourselves in her shoes, imagining all the racism and ignorance—general buffoonery—that she’s had to endure, but that she’s been unable to acknowledge because of her role.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">What must she be thinking behind that poise? And what if she said it out loud? Yakira Chambers, the actress who played her, delivered lines like, “If it was me up there, I would have called Romney out the moment he said ‘poor’ instead of ‘low-income,’ but it wasn’t me up there. Although it could have been. ’Cuz, I mean, my approval rating is high as hell!” Of course, this wasn’t the real Michelle. We were just projecting ourselves onto her, but that’s what I loved about having a black woman in the White House: So many of us felt like we could walk in her shoes. We understood her position.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"I identified with her, beyond the color of her skin, by how real she seemed."<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Yakira and I came up with the idea while sitting around talking about Michelle and how proud we were of her. The sketch was motivated by admiration, but I still worried she might be offended if she saw it. I sent the first version to my mom—for advice, I always go to her—with the note, “I don’t want anybody to find any excuse to criticize her because of this.” At first, my mom was like, “Shut up, I’m sure it’s fine.” But as soon as she’d watched it, she changed her mind: “Don’t you dare put this out! Ever. In your life.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We were protective of our first black first lady. I remember watching Barack in the primaries, before he had been elected for his first term. I’d looked up who he was and who his family was, and thought, “What? He’s married to a black woman? And not only a black woman, but a dark-skinned black woman!” And then I learned more about her background—how intelligent she is, how she had reservations about him running for president. I identified with her, beyond the color of her skin, by how real she seemed.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I wasn’t surprised by how levelheaded she was, but, also, I was completely surprised by how level-headed she was! Even though I knew how accomplished she was, how did she stay so cool in the spotlight? I’d read about Michelle’s mother staying in the White House to take care of Sasha and Malia, making sure they stayed grounded and didn’t get spoiled. I’d never heard anything like that coming from the White House before. But of course their grandmother would be there! That’s such a black thing, to bring the whole family around. It felt like they weren’t letting the presidency faze them. They made the White House suit their lives rather than change themselves. I was surprised and proud. They felt so familiar to me.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I went to the White House for the first time when I was invited to attend their last annual holiday party, thankfully having forgotten about that video we made years earlier. My mom was the first person I thought to invite. We got through the endless security, at which point it all dawned on me in such a real way: Here I am. A black woman. In the White House. Invited there by a black president and his black wife. And then Barack came out, hugged my mom, told me he watches my show, Insecure, and made the announcement that Michelle was sick. In my head, again, I was projecting: “Yeah, she’s sick—sick of all this shit!” And even though I never met her that night, her presence was felt in the warmth and positive energy that presided over the party.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While so many people have applauded her poise, her sense of fashion, her class, and her demeanor, others have been quick to tear down her appearance and compare her to a primate, a racist trope with a deep past. She must have been aware of every slight, and yet she never seemed to notice. Part of me hurt for her. I might not have been able to put myself in her shoes for a parody video, but I certainly understand the type of hatred that she must have endured, and I was proud of how she rose above it.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"I want it to be very clear that Insecure came out during the Obama era as a result of the Obamas."<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Her essence has bolstered my own confidence. It has allowed me, and the character I’ve created on my TV show Insecure, to expand beyond the idea someone else has of how a young black woman should behave. I don’t need to prove anything to anyone. I can just be.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Every time I’m asked how I’m going to address the current presidency on my show, I stop and think about the statement I’d like to make. But ultimately the show itself is the statement. Twenty years from now, when Insecure is ancient, I want it to be very clear that the show came out during the Obama era as a result of the Obamas. I think people are going to trace back the renaissance of black American art—whether it’s a painting by Kerry James Marshall or an episode of Atlanta—to having had them in the White House. I don’t know that it’s direct, but I believe we’ll be able to connect the dots down the line.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Courage Is Contagious: And Other Reasons to Be Grateful for Michelle Obama is available now. <a data-external=true href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/Courage-Contagious-Reasons-Grateful-Michelle/dp/039959261X data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=BUY class="body-btn-link css-lihu0l emevuu60">BUY</a></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Essay by Issa Rae from COURAGE IS CONTAGIOUS edited by Nick Haramis, copyright © 2017 by Issa Rae.

Keep reading for what happened to Rachel and Brayden on their journeys to love.</p><p>Rachel Recchia (who was on The Bachelor Season 26 and The Bachelorette Season 19) and Brayden Bowers (who was on The Bachelorette Season 20) are two contestants on Bachelor in Paradise Season 9. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Bachelor in Paradise</a> is a spinoff of The Bachelor and The Bachelorette. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>The Bachelor</a> franchise premiered on ABC in March 2002 with businessman Alex Michel as the first Bachelor. The show has since aired for more than 27 seasons and produced several spin-offs including <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>The Bachelorette</a>,<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#> Bachelor in Paradise</a>, Bachelor Pad, The Bachelor Presents: Listen to Your Heart, and The Bachelor Winter Games.&nbsp;</p><p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Bachelor in Paradise</a> premiered in August 2014 as a reality TV dating series featuring former contestants from The Bachelor and The Bachelorette. The show starts with an uneven number of women and men from The Bachelor and The Bachelorette. Each week, there’s a Rose Ceremony where either the men or women give roses to the contestants they feel the strongest connection to. The contestants who don’t receive a rose are sent home.</p><p>The next week, the roles are reversed, and the gender that didn’t give out roses the previous week now chooses who to give a rose to and who to send home. Each week, more contestants from past seasons of The Bachelor and The Bachelorette join the show to create an uneven number between the women and men and force the contestants already there to either couple up with someone new or stay in their current relationship. Contestants are also given date cards at random to choose contestants they want to spend alone time with. Many new contestants join the show with a date card.</p><p>At the end of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Bachelor in Paradise</a>, the contestants are offered an opportunity to have an overnight date with no cameras or microphones (much like Fantasy Suites on The Bachelor and The Bachelorette.) After the overnight dates is the finale, where contestants either choose to break up or get engaged. Like The Bachelor and The Bachelorette, Bachelor in Paradise also has an “After the Final Rose” special, where contestants reunite to hash out drama and update viewers on their relationship.</p><p>But back to Rachel and Brayden. So… are <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Rachel and Brayden still together from Bachelor in Paradise 2023</a> and did they get engaged in the BIP Season 9 finale?

The answer is no. Rachel Recchia (The Bachelor Season 26 and The Bachelorette Season 19) and Brayden Bowers (The Bachelorette Season 20) are not still together after they broke up in the middle of Bachelor in Paradise Season 9, according to Reality Steve.</p><p>Reality Steve reported that Rachel self-eliminated after her breakup with Brayden. Rachel and Brayden broke up after Becca Serrano, who was on The Bachelor Season 27 with Zach Shallcross, arrived to Bachelor in Paradise Season 9 with a date card and went on a date with Brayden. Brayden chose Becca over Rachel, which led Rachel to self-eliminate.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=7.5><h2>Who's Rachel from Bachelor in Paradise Season 9?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Rachel-Bachelor-in-Paradise-2023.jpg><p>Who’s Rachel from Bachelor in Paradise 2023?

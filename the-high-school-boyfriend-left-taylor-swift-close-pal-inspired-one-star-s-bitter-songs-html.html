We were 14, we were just being girly, snarky.'&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Chelsea also told how everyone at their school was mesmerized by Taylor's self-titled first album, and tried to figure out who each of the songs was about.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>She said: 'We know other people she wrote songs about.

She was different, she wasn't super popular, she kind of did her own thing.

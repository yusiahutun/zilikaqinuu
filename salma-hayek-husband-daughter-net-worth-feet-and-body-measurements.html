She gained fame in Mexico by starring in a local telenovela Teresa. In 1991 she moved from Mexico to Los Angeles to discover her talents and passion.</p><p>In the leading role in the 1995 classic Desperado opposite Antonio Banderas, Hayek announced in Hollywood. Her stunning performance in the film earned Hayek several other roles, and her Hollywood career took a serious upswing.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Salma Hayek Biography</strong></h2><p>Salma Hayek Jiménez was born in Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, Mexico, the daughter of the mother of an opera singer and talented scout, Diana Jiménez Medina, and her husband Sami Hayek Domínguez, who runs a successful oil company and also runs an industrial equipment company. Hayek’s father once ran for mayor of her hometown of Coatzacoalcos.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Does Henry Cavill (Superman) Have A Wife or Girlfriend?</a></strong></p><p>Salma Hayek describes herself as 50% Lebanese and 50% Spanish. Her mother is of Spanish descent, while her Mexican father was originally from Lebanon. Hayek visited her father’s hometown Baabdat in Lebanon in 2015 to promote her film Kahlil Gibran’s The Prophet.</p><p>Her younger brother, Sami, works as a furniture designer. Hayek admits that she and her brother were spoiled by their father, a spirited businessman. Her family was also a devout Roman Catholic family. Hayek says, however, that she no longer believes in the church institution, but she still believes in God.</p><p>At the age of twelve, young Hayek was sent to the Academy of the Sacred Heart in Grand Coteau, Louisiana, USA, where she was diagnosed with dyslexia. She studied International Relations at the Universidad Iberoamericana in the capital of her home country.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Salma Hayek Acting Career</strong></h2><p>At the age of 23, Hayek won the title role in the telenovela, Teresa, in 1989. The popular telenovela made her a star in Mexico. In 1991 Hayek moved to Los Angeles, California, to promote her talents. Teresa’s fans, however, were inconsolable that her beloved leading actress left her.</p><p>Hayek rose to prominence with roles in films such as the 1995 classic Desperado, From Dusk till Dawn (1996), Dogma (1999), and Will Smith’s high-budget Wild Wild West (1999).</p><p>She soon founded her own production company, which she called Ventanarosa. The company got off to a good start and was responsible for the Mexican feature film No One Writes to the Colonel (1999). The film received positive reviews and was screened at the Cannes Film Festival and selected as Mexico’s official Oscar entry for Best Foreign Film.</p><p>She played her groundbreaking role in the artist biography Frida in 2002, which she also co-produced. The leading role in the film as the iconic Mexican painter “Frida Kahlo” earned Hayek a nomination for Best Actress at the Oscars, BAFTA, Screen Actors Guild, and Golden Globe Awards. Frida won two Academy Awards out of six nominations – for film music and make-up.</p><p>The Mexican-born actress cemented her status as Hollywood queen in the 2002 biography of legendary Mexican painter Frida Kahlo. Frida was not just another film for Hayek, it was her dream role, and that is why she put so much passion and enthusiasm into the film. All this hard work paid off, as Frida was nominated for six Oscars, including Best Actress for Hayek.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Salma Hayek Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Marriage to a billionaire has not slowed Salma Hayek down in her film career. Her billionaire husband is worth a lot of money, but Hayek has also amassed a fortune on her own.</p><p>Her net worth is estimated at around 85 million dollars. The project with the highest turnover in which Hayek was involved in the comedy “Grown Ups” from 2010, which earned 165 million dollars.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Husband</strong></h2><p>Salma Hayek is married to French billionaire François-Henri Pinault, a French businessman who has been Chairman and CEO of luxury goods group Kering SA since 2005. The couple announced their engagement in March 2007 and got married in Paris on Valentine’s Day 2009. A second ceremony took place in Venice.</p><p>Hayek’s husband was named in a high-profile alimony fight with his ex-girlfriend, supermodel Linda Evangelista, which claimed he was the father of the supermodel’s son, Augustin James. The boy was born in 2006, a year before Pinault had even gotten engaged to his wife. Pinault denied all allegations and settled out of court with Evangelista.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>A Closer Look At Lisa Bonet’s Children, Husband and Parents</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Daughter</strong></h2><p>Hayek announced that she was expecting a daughter on 9 March 2007, the same day that she announced her engagement. She welcomed her daughter Valentina Paloma Pinault on 2 September 2007, together with François-Henri Pinault, who was her fiancé at that time. Her daughter was delivered at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Sexual Assault</strong></h2><p>She recently joined the league of high-profile actresses who accused Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual harassment. According to the actress, Weinstein tried to sabotage her 2002 Oscar-winning film Frida because she had repeatedly rejected his advances. Hayek admitted that Weinstein even threatened to break her kneecaps!</p><p>She also revealed that she had previously been approached by various reporters to talk about this unfortunate encounter, but she was too ashamed and did not want her daughter to know about it. Let’s hope it will help Hayek to cope with this dark episode of her life when she pronounces her ordeal. However, Harvey Weinstein continued to deny all allegations of non-consensual sexual activity.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Hayek’s Feet and Body Measurements</strong></h2><p>Great gifts they say come in small packages. Salma Hayek is surely one such gift. Her confidence transcends the screen and is almost palpable. However, this highly talented actress and producer stand at a height of 5ft 2 inches. She also has an hourglass figure which beautifully complements her petite frame.</p><p>Her body measurements are 39 inches bust, 24 inches waist, and 36 inches hips. If that doesn’t scream “bombshell” then what will? As the confident woman she is, Hayek has never been afraid to flaunt her assets.</p><p>Salma Hayek’s feet/shoe size is 6.5 (US). She weighs about 123 lbs.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kwKK4zJpkoZmpmrhutNSsmZqmlGKxosHGoaueql2jsrV51qipraBdm7KmwIyapZ1lkqSxunnMnpisraKauqa606xm</p></div><div id=links><a href=./shaun-white-dating-history.html>&#171;&nbsp;Shaun White's Girlfriend History Plus, Who Is He Dating Now?</a>

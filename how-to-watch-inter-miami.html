Right now, I am feeling very comfortable. I’ve talked to friends who have been here their whole lives and even they suffer and don’t get used to it. As for artificial grass, I played on it during my youth, it’s been a long time since I’ve played on it, but I don’t have a problem playing on that kind of surface,” he said.</p><p>He continued, “People in this city and this club have made it easy for us. The fans, the people that I meet every day on the streets… It’s a spectacular city, and that’s why I am happy. We are in that adaptation period, we don’t have a house yet, the kids are going to school soon, and that will help us get used to daily life. It’s been much easier than we thought. The move from Barcelona to Paris was somewhat complicated, but this has been easy.”</p><p>With Messi now playing for Florida, there’s no question that fans across the world want to know how to watch Inter Miami games live online for free to see how one of the GOATs of international football does this season.

The answer is no. At a press conference in August 2023, Inter Miami head coach Tara Martino confirmed that Messi was set to miss “at least” three Inter Miami games this season to play for his national team, though he is set to return. “The importance is that we value winning and winning this way because it’s something we have to get accustomed to. Leo is gonna miss at least three games,” Martino said. “He’s gonna get called up by his national team and others too. We know that the team has to continue to win without them at times.”</p><p>Messi announced he was joining Inter Miami in June 2023 after leaving his previous team, Paris Saint-Germaine. “I have made the decision that I am going to Miami. I still don’t have it agreed upon 100 percent and a few things are needed, but, well, we decided to continue my path there,” Messi told Mundo Deportivo and Sport at the time. “After winning the World Cup and not being able to return to Barcelona, it was my turn to go to the league of the United States to live football in another way and to enjoy the day-to-day more. Obviously, with the same responsibility and desire to play well and do things well as always. But in a calmer way.”</p><p>The Major League Soccer also confirmed the move in its own statement at the time. “We are pleased that Lionel Messi has stated that he intends to join Inter Miami and Major League Soccer this summer,” MLS said in a written statement. “Although work remains to finalize a formal agreement, we look forward to welcoming one of the greatest soccer players of all time to our League.”</p><p>FC Barcelona, whom Messi played with from 2003 to 2021, also wished him the “best of luck in his new professional phase.” “Jorge Messi, the player’s father and representative, informed Club President Joan Laporta of the player’s decision to join Inter Miami, despite having been presented with a proposal from Barça, in consideration of the desire of both FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi for him to once again wear blaugrana,” Barca said in a statement.</p><p>Sources told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ESPN</a> at the time Messi’s move included an option for part-ownership in Inter Miami, which wouldn’t be subsidized by the league like it was for David Beckham. ESPN reported that, when Beckham moved to LA Galaxy in 2007, he was given the option to purchase an MLS team for a discounted price of $25 million.</p><p>Messi also explaine to the Miami Herald in 2023 why he decided to make the move to Inter Miami. “It was a family decision, with my wife and kids. And I can tell you today I am very happy with the decision we made, not only from a sporting perspective, but for how my family lives every day,” he said. “We are enjoying the city which has been very welcoming. Not only in Miami, but we played in Dallas the other day, and the people welcomed me and embraced me, and I am grateful and happy for this moment because I’m enjoying playing this game I have loved all my life.”</p><p>He also told the newspaper about how familiar he was with Miami before making the move there. “I had been to Miami several times. The first time I don’t remember exactly, but I think it was to play a friendly game. I also have been here with my family,” he said. He also acknowledged the city’s massive Latin American population.</p><p>“I am not surprised because I had been here, I knew it was like that, the number of Latinos here, and it is a beautiful thing to be able to live among them now. To be able to enjoy the games with the fans here who fill the stadium. Us Latin people are very fanatical and passionate about what we love, and we demonstrate that in our day-to-day lives. I feel at home here,” he said.</p><p>Messi also commented on Miami’s notorious traffic. “The big cities always have a lot of traffic. That was the case in Paris, too, in Buenos Aires and Barcelona. You need to have patience and tranquility, and also leave home a little earlier to make sure you get there on time,” he said.</p><p>Inter Miami games are available to stream on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Apple TV Plus</a>.

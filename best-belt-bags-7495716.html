Unlike a classic shoulder purse or tote, the hands-free pouch can be worn to casual, formal, and athletic ventures all the same. It’s no surprise, therefore, that blogger and style consultant Lauren Parry converted to mostly using the belt bag over any other bag in recent times. “Whether I’m headed out for errands, traveling, going to a concert venue or sporting event, belt bags are a game changer.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The versatile piece comes in a wide range of styles and materials, however, so finding the best belt bag came with a little more R & D than usual. We individually tried almost all of the listed belt bags, so that we could see what perk each option offered — be it ample amounts of pockets or hidden water bottle pouches. We also relied on the influences of the internet, finding highly rated products that shoppers can’t seem to get enough of. Together, we were able to find the top belt bags for any occasion, below.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-dagne-dover-ace-fanny-pack></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dagne Dover Ace Fanny Pack</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=954 data-sizes=750px alt="Dagne Dover Fanny Pack" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/LKIhCD74O0-_OzDeyUWWyU5CN_8=/fit-in/1500x954/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/DagneDoverFannyPack-a358e7757b9f47c9b5469da1453e36d8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dagne Dover</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> Out of all the belt bags we tested, we found ourselves reaching for this one the most thanks to its effortless style, long belt, and comfortable wear.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>There isn’t an extra slot for you to hide your phone away.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We fell in love with the Dagne Dover fanny pack the second we pulled it out of its pouch. Everything from the size, material, and ergonomics appealed to us. Unlike your typical cotton or leather belt bag, this one is made of premium neoprene, Dagne Dover’s signature tear-resistant fabric, which feels thick, plush, and high-end. When we (accidentally) poured coffee over it while camping, it simply rolled right off the bag without leaving a trace, which was incredibly impressive. There are two zipped pockets — a little one at the front and another for the main pocket —&nbsp;with a little credit card slot, key hook, and chapstick strap inside. None of these slits were big enough to compartmentalize our phones away, so that needed to sit in the main cabin along with our wallet, snacks, hair clip, and notebook.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The strap also felt substantial — thick, sturdy, and easily adjustable. It can extend up to 36 inches long, which made it easy to sling across our bodies and change up the style a little. It even fit flawlessly over our thick coat — one that has hide sleeves. Its versatility and generous size allowed us to travel all around Los Angeles, Denver, and Seattle with it, leaving not a single scratch or tear on the bag.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>7<strong> | Material: </strong>Premium neoprene, recycled repreve <strong>| Size: </strong>W 9.25” x H 5.5” x D 2.75</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bianca Kratky</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-ododos-unisex-mini-belt-bag-with-adjustable-strap></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ododos Unisex Mini Belt Bag with Adjustable Strap</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ododos Unisex Mini Belt Bag with Adjustable Strap" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/MjJT-RvgXVKIVYv-HIS5bxMiIYA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ododos-unisex-mini-belt-bag-with-adjustable-strap-small-waist-pouch-for-workout-running-travelling-hiking-black-cadafe74739f4d0583d18e917e82cf04.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Despite the small size, we found that we can fit a lot of items into the pouch.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The stichting doesn’t feel extremely sturdy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There’s a certain very popular belt bag, namely the Lululemon Everywhere Belt Bag (more on that below), and we found this Ododos Mini Belt Bag to be the perfect dupe. We found it extremely practical, because although it’s quite small in size, it still fit all our essentials. The strap adjusts easily, allowing us to alternate between carrying it around our waist and as a sling depending on the activity we were engaged in. We’ve taken it on hikes, to run errands, to festivals, and on travels, as it can be easily incorporated into any outfit and holds almost anything we put in it, from wallets to phones to granola bars and keys. We could even stuff a <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">small Fiji water bottle in it</a>. The mesh divider inside the pouch also helped compartmentalize some items. As an affordable item, the stitching is not always extremely sturdy, we found. At times we worried that the zipper might rip, but if it ever did, it wouldn’t hurt to repurchase the item at this price.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>20<strong> | Material: </strong>Nylon <strong>| Size: </strong>W 8” x H 5” x D 2”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Chloe Caldwell</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-senreve-aria-belt-bag></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Senreve Belt Bag</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=800 data-sizes=750px alt="Senreve Aria Belt Bag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/CnudHZPwUNmx0VCFQjDu-2zAQGs=/fit-in/1500x800/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Senreve-Aria-Belt-Bag-9e38f6a2fec645ce99c6c1b2f69d4338.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Senreve</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>You can customize the strap.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The leather wont weather great against friction or sweat, so it’s only reserved for more elevated events<strong></strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In keeping with Senreve’s luxurious style, the Aria belt bag has to be one of the brand’s most practical bags. Coming with a stylish front flap (with a magnetic snap closure), an extra exterior pouch, and a stain-resistant micro-suede interior, the bag fit all of our essentials including a phone, wallet, lip gloss, keys, and sunglasses. Believe it or not, we even fit a foldable shopping bag and a small umbrella. Inside the zippered compartment we kept our airpods, although a small wallet would have fit as well. Two card slots made our hotel card and metrocard easy to access.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The leather belt portion isn’t sewn onto the bag, so we were able to remove it and swap it for this <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">chain </a>we bought on Amazon. As a matter of fact, we loved styling it in various ways, using it as a clutch one day, a belt bag another, and a crossbody for nights out. It simply elevated any look with its expensive appeal without loudly showing off any designer labels (keeping to that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>quiet luxury trend</a>). The leather is not going to weather well against friction, sweat, or rain, however, so make sure to pick the right day and outfit to wear it with.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>22<strong> | Material: </strong>Italian leather<strong>| Size: </strong>W 8” x H 5” x D 2”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-sport-lululemon-everywhere-belt-bag-large-2l></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Sport</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>lululemon Everywhere Belt Bag</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="lululemon Everywhere Belt Bag Large 2L" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ZNP8oX59vOvUyDfszBqCkMrgk4Q=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/LululemonEverywhereBeltBagLarge2L-3bc4a8555301404d8758b51967ec713d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>lululemon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It seems to expand internally, holding all of our essentials with ease.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>You cannot wash this bag.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Hikers, runners, and ballers, if you don’t already have the Lululemon belt bag, allow us a minute of your time to convert you. The bag somehow expanded internally to fit whatever we wanted, not unlike the bag Mary Poppins had, even though the exterior seems small and compact (and thereby never getting in the way of our activities). We were able to fit our phones, keys, airpods, lip balms, and even the ball we then used to play tennis with. For us trail blazers, this bag holds trail mix and a bottle of facial sunscreen as well. In the back pocket, we were able to stash our phones and keep it flush against the body. Somehow, even with all of our goodies, the bag remained nice and lightweight. It made it very appealing on days when we knew we would be out for a long time. The water-repellent fabric makes it ideal for outdoor use, too. The only con here is that you cannot wash it. If we want to give it a little refresh, we have to spot clean it carefully.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>4 <strong>| Material: </strong>Recycled polyester, recycled nylon <strong>| Size: </strong>W 8.3” x H 5.7” x D 2.2”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-plus-size-athleta-all-about-crossbody-belt-bag></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Plus Size</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Athleta Belt Bag</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Athleta All About Belt Bag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/tFmeO8r6HhuVph17pjtu5om-sio=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Athleta-All-About-Belt-Bag-62116bc0e0ff4e8b8e34dfbd8ddeb34d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Athleta</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It has a UPF 50+ protection and is water-repellent.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The strap feels a little thin and doesn’t hold the weight of the bag up against the waist properly.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For a little more sporty and casual look, take a look at this belt bag from Athleta, which entrepreneur and fashion consultant Katie Sturino wears on power walks. We found this one to be smaller and more compact compared to the other options, like the Dagne Dover or Calpak bags, which made the bag much more discreet and practical for grabbing our essentials and running out the house. The smaller size also makes it easier to wear underneath a jacket without looking too bulky. And while most exterior pockets usually come in a tiny slit, big enough for maybe some keys, this one is big enough to fit a 1.52 ounce hand cream. Accessing our belongings was also very easy here as the zipper curves down the sides of the bag, making it open up widely. And as a little cherry on top, it’s both water-repellent and UPF 50+ protected, making this ideal for everyday adventures out and about.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our biggest quarrel with the bag was that the strap was rather slim. While it does feed into a clean and minimalist aesthetic, when wrapped around our waist, the weight of the bag pulled it down a little which felt awkward at times. That being said, we appreciated how long the strap was, making it fit a variety of bodies. Any excess strap could easily be tucked into the rubber piece to prevent any dangling.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>3 <strong>| Material: </strong>Polyester, recycled polyester<strong> | Size: </strong>W 7” x H 4.5” x D 2”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-most-spacious-calpak-luka-belt-bag></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Most Spacious</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Calpak Luka Belt Bag</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nordstrom Calpak Luka Belt Bag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/qEEDUG2jxVNmKm5ZJ5RP0eFMjD8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Calpak-Luka-Belt-Bag-ff6a6d22b359401d99b58046d6f43bcd.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It's extremely spacious without being too bulky.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The strap feels a little flimsy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The luggage specialists at Calpak knew what they were doing when they designed this Luka belt bag. The bag is deceivingly spacious, fitting our large hair claw, wallet, phone, dog treats, and even a ball. But while most bags that fit that many things look and feel bulky, this one remains rather flat against the hip. It’s definitely bigger than the Athelta option, or even the Dagne Dover one, but we didn’t find it heavy or taking too much space. Most notable, however, was the hidden back pocket. It’s quite large, and even fit our phone sans-problem. We imagine this would become a huge help while on the go, when you want to keep your passport as secure and close to you as possible. The cushiony exterior also felt comfortable on our bodies and protective on our valuables. And as a little extra bonus, it’s water-resistant,&nbsp;thereby keeping everything nice and dry while you’re sightseeing, in case you get caught in the rain. Even the zipper felt superior, gliding open and closed seamlessly. The only thing we didn’t love was the strap. While it is very gracious in length, its softness lacks structure and width, making it feel a little flimsy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>7 <strong>| Material: </strong>Polyester<strong> | Size: </strong>W 8.5” x H 5.25” x D 1.5”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bianca Kratky</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-sling-the-north-face-womens-isabella-sling></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Sling</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>The North Face Isabella Sling</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="The North Face Women&amp;rsquo;s Isabella Sling" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/_FHgsPoN4oj7V23ETRgvoSbcuOE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/The-North-Face-Womens-Isabella-Sling-5b2c983389ee42049186d39a732803be.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>The North Face</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>There is a pocket with a soft interior lining that’s perfect for delicate items like sunglasses.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>We wish it came in more color options</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Sure, a sling bag doesn’t necessarily constitute a belt bag, but we felt it necessary to highlight this alternative as something more mom-friendly. We were able to not just carry our own essentials, but our kids toys, snacks, and juice boxes in this North Face Isabella Sling. Our hands remained free, and the snap buckle closure on the strap allowed us to easily remove the bag once home or paused between errands. Best of all for folks always working, the large compartment even had space for our iPad, which allowed us to get work done during a quick break from running around.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The organization capabilities on this bag were also impressive. While in a rush, it was always easy to know exactly where all of our things were, sparing us from rummaging through what seems like a black hole. There’s a pocket on the strap where we kept our phone for easy access, as well as a front pocket with a softer lining, good for keeping sunglasses scratch-free. We only wish we had more color options, as the cream would get dirty quickly and the blue is not always fitting to our outfits. A classic black would have sealed the deal.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>Recycled polyester<strong> | Material: | Size: </strong>W 9.5” x H 14.5” x D 5.5”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-unisex-uniqlo-round-mini-shoulder-bag></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Unisex</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Uniqlo Round Mini Shoulder Bag</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Uniqlo Round Mini Shoulder Bag " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/zvDCAlS50m6pD030qPeWjnp45Og=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/uniqlo-round-mini-shoulder-bag-6aa90e68b97b4cc9bab2349b1bbb30f7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Uniqlo</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It fits an impressive amount of items in the pouch.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>We wish it had outer pockets.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">People of all genders and ages have something to love about the Uniqlo mini shoulder bag. While it isn’t labeled as a belt bag, it holds many of the same functions as one — and you can wear it as such. The simple demi-circle design might not seem like much at first, but it holds an impressive amount of items while on the go, including airpods, wallets, keys, and even a 16 ounce water bottle. The unisex appeal made it easy to share with our significant other, with whom we now alternate usage of the bag. We also loved just how lightweight the bag is. It’s thickly lined so that it doesn’t feel at risk of tearing, but weighs as much as a T-shirt. With adjustable straps that accommodate a range of body sizes, we felt that this bag would be universally loved by all. Unfortunately, there aren’t many compartments inside the bag, nor is there an outer pocket. You will have to be okay with throwing everything into one big pouch.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>8 <strong>| Material: </strong>Polyester<strong> | Size: </strong>W 11” x H 6.7” x D 3.9”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-most-durable-jansport-fifth-ave-fanny-pack></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Most Durable</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>JanSport Fanny Pack</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1001 data-sizes=750px alt="JanSport Fifth Ave Fanny Pack" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/0c93kzd1ulnZVjCwo2khc5Ypz10=/fit-in/1500x1001/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/JanSport-Fifth-Ave-Fanny-Pack-8432ce13e4c7439bb0d9ca1a2e585af4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>JanSport</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The durable canvas will easily last over a decade.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s a little chunky and large.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’ve ever had a Jansport backpack in high school, then you already know how much weight (and careless tossing around) the bag can withstand. It’s likely the beat up bag is still in your closet somewhere, looking a little dusty but ready to be at your service at any given moment. You can expect the same durability in this indestructible fanny pack.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">More than just reliable materials, however, the bag was thoughtfully constructed. The exterior pocket is not just there for decoration, as some tiny bags have, but spacious enough to hold hand creams and a facial sunscreen. We were able to place everything from small notebooks to snacks along with our everyday essentials in here. On top of being very strong and stretch-resistant, the strap is easily adjustable and long enough to wear around the waist or around the body. As a size 16, we felt we had enough of the strap to wrap around our body, so we definitely qualify it as size inclusive. All of these great amenities are bundled into a rather large and chunky looking bag, which may not be fit for a stylish day in town, but is perfect for travel and exploring.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>5<strong> | Material: </strong>Recycled polyester<strong> | Size: </strong>W 6” x H 10” x D 2.5”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-travel-patagonia-ultralight-black-hole-mini-hip-pack></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Travel</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Patagonia Ultralight Black Hole Mini Hip Pack</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Patagonia Ultra-light Black Hole Mini Hip Pack 1L" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/MBqWdeidxHpQenqjQL4UnYCB3ps=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/patagonia-ultra-light-black-hole-mini-hip-pack-1l-6ed8e67fd4a04efea0271ee6a7e69bfc.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Patagonia</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s tear and weather resistant while being extremely lightweight.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It doesn’t have many neutral color options.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Belt bags in general are always great options for travel, but this one in particular has a leg up on the rest for two very unique reasons. The first is that it can be converted into a carrying pouch simply by turning inside out — this allows for easy packing and transport. The second is that it’s extremely lightweight, almost featherlike, minimizing the amount of weight you need to schlep around on your trips.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We traveled around Europe with this bag and found it extremely easy to pack our everyday essentials. Passports, chapsticks, sunglasses, wallets, and airpods alike fit into the two main compartments of the bag. Despite it being small and airy, the recycled nylon ripstop fabric was very durable and even weather-resistant, expertly protecting all of our valuables. The strap was also quite long, which made it easy to adjust around our bodies whether we wanted to wear it on our hips or diagonally across our chests. It always remained flush against our bodies which freed up our eyes (and conscious) to take in the sights worry-free. Aside from the black, the bag isn’t offered in many neutral tones, making it difficult to match with our carefully curated travel outfits.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>6<strong> | Material: </strong>Recycled nylon ripstop <strong>| Size: </strong>W 4.75” x H 8” x D 2”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-expandable-peak-design-field-pouch-v2></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Expandable</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Peak Design Field Pouch V2</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=999 data-sizes=750px alt="Peak Design Field Pouch V2" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/-YdtPVWq1KjaP2wWT084cg8vXRE=/fit-in/1500x999/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Peak-Design-Field-Pouch-V2-bc58fff1b4a74d2ca5fd42ee13aa7a0b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Peak Design</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The interior is felted, soft enough for delicate camera gear.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The straps are a little slim and flimsy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">On any given day, your essentials can change from just a wallet and a phone to a camera, water bottle, and a tripod. Peak Design took our ranging activities to mind and created this expandable waist bag. It can carry anything between 1.5 liters to three liters, simply by extending the top fold. It features a zipper closure, eight compartments, and a soft interior lining fit to protect any camera gear. In other words, it’s ideal for the outdoorsy adventurers who need their extra batteries and different lenses easily grabbable, on top of their other essentials.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But don’t worry, you don’t need to be a photographer to enjoy this bag. We found it plenty useful as a travel bag as well, leaning the pouch on our hips while using the long straps as a crossbody bag. Which brings us to an important note: the straps were a little thin and flimsy. We wish they were thicker, or able to convert into a belt, but instead we mostly used it as a messenger bag.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>3<strong> | Material: </strong>Nylon, leather<strong> | Size: </strong>W 7.5” x H 9.4” x D 0.4”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-everyday-alo-explorer-fanny-pack></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Everyday</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Alo Explorer Fanny Pack</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Alo Explorer Fanny Pack" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/gilj5QdoAQrgtIZRBEGDGoIWx0U=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Alo-Explorer-Fanny-Pack-7895a294c723492899bc9d7bb92739d7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Alo Yoga</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>We could even fit a rolled up tote bag and a water bottle in this bag.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s not weather-proof.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For our everyday pick, we wanted something sleek, well designed, and durable — this Alo Explorer Fanny Pack fit the bill. It has three zipped compartments: in the main one, we fit everything from a rolled up tote bag to a water bottle. On the front pack, we kept our airpods and our keys (although there’s room for more), and in the back zippered compartment we concealed our phones, so that it could safely remain flush against our body.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There’s a metal buckle on the strap which feels significant and sturdy, making it easy to snap on and off. The whole body of the bag has a smooth satin-like finish to it and puts up a strong fight against any distressors. Even after wearing it daily, it showed zero scratches or rips. That being said, it’s not weather-proof. If a sudden rain shower commences, make sure to hover over your bag to protect it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>2<strong> | Material: </strong>Nylon <strong>| Size: </strong>W 4.75” x H 10.75” x D 4.75”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-leather-quince-italian-pebbled-leather-sling-bag></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Leather</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Quince Italian Pebbled Leather Sling Bag</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Quince Italian Pebbled Leather Sling Bag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/UxJoZpvN9YpCVDlL0y9_5oXbIWI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Quince-Italian-Pebbled-Leather-Sling-Bag-94c10624b2cd43d7987039b14da70700.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Quince</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Despite its sleek and slim appearance, it fits a surprisingly large amount of things.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The clasp on the strap is harder to handle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you thought you couldn’t wear fanny packs to a nice dinner, think again. This leather option from Quince offers a more elevated touch to belt bags, with its pebbled exterior and slim body. At a first glance (and touch), it was evident how well the bag was made. The leather felt thick and soft to the touch, somehow managing to be durable without being stiff or rough. And even through nights prancing around, it has yet to reveal any scratches or markings.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The bag is slim but long, so while it may look like it won’t fit a whole lot, it surprisingly accepted all we offered it without a fight. A card holder, phone, airpod case, keys. Lipsticks, gum, and pill case all nestled into the main compartment. There is also an internal leather card slot that could fit two cards at most and a zippered pocket on the back panel for any emergency cash. The strap is closed with a clasp, rather than a buckle, which added to its sleek appearance. Although we do have to say, it’s not as easy to hook on and off each time, so we mostly resorted to pulling it over our heads.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>3<strong> | Material: </strong>Leather, cotton <strong>| Size: </strong>W 11” x H 5.75” x D 1.5”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-waist-silver-and-riley-parisian-leather-belt-bag></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Waist</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Silver and Riley Leather Belt Bag</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=800 data-sizes=750px alt="Silver and Riley Parisian Leather Belt Bag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/zu8a7e9clTHOxe1qGpdgpisJHUo=/fit-in/1500x800/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Silver-and-Riley-Parisian-Leather-Belt-Bag-3dde928932e7422eaab81771debac0c5.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Silver and Riley</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The calfskin leather will only become better with time.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It comes with complicated care instructions.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Few belt bags on this list are designed specifically to be worn at your waist — most fit around your hips or are intended to be worn as a sling — so if that’s how you intend on wearing it, we’d love to introduce you to the Silver and Riley bag. The belt on this one was sized to wrap around your waist, so it sits higher than your standard belt bag. It offers you the ability to wear it with different styles, like a dress, instead of just some jeans. Made with structured calf leather from Italy, the little pouch has a minimalist appeal, with only a single extra pocket in the interior, big enough to hold some cards or loose change. Otherwise, the sleek design feels very mature, and is available in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">light brown</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="nofollow nocaes">pink</a> as well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It does come with a few complicated care instructions, however. The brand recommends avoiding direct sunlight, rain, or heat. They also recommend keeping a tissue paper in the interior when not in use, to maintain the shape and absorb any moisture. If you hope to maintain its pristine condition, take heed of these precautions.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>3 <strong>| Material: </strong>Calf skin leather <strong>| Size: </strong>W 6” x H 5” x D 2.4”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-designer-bottega-veneta-cassette-belt-bag></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Designer</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Bottega Veneta Cassette Belt Bag</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Bottega Veneta Cassette Belt Bag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/SU1OUQn66pBfwOtKq7Af6GIWjMM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/bottega-veneta-cassette-belt-bag-f0554689f2b947c99e4633f73807b1d7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bottega Veneta</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The criss cross pattern is easy to dress up or down.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s not very big, so you won’t be able to fit all your essentials in it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Bottega cassette bag took the world by storm, so of course, we had to mention it. Aside from being visibly very cute, the leather used by Bottega feels substantial, even more so than other designers. Writer Bianca Kratky has a similar bag from them, and can confirm that the 100 percent lambskin leather is softer, yet sturdier than anything she’s handled before. On top of that, the simple criss cross pattern can be incorporated into any outfit, be it sporty or classy. At 6.9 inches in width, it will fit less essentials than the Dagne Dover option, but it looks more elevated. And you can still fit most needs, like a phone, card holder, keys and some lipstick. But anything more might require you to fit it in your pants pockets or to leave home.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>10 <strong>| Material: </strong>Lambskin leather<strong> | Size: </strong>W 6.9” x H 3.7” x D 2”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-minimalist-banana-republic-heritage-leather-belt-bag></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Minimalist</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Banana Republic Leather Belt Bag</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Banana Republic Heritage Leather Belt Bag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/3779_pfujMyxeYZJIoMWzeinJOU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Banana-Republic-Heritage-Leather-Belt-Bag-e94715059124430b95cefa2db09496aa.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Banana Republic</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Despite the lack of zippers, this all-leather belt bag remains securely shut at all times.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The one inch depth is a little too slim to fit a phone and a wallet side by side.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-77 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This belt bag truly looks and feels like it was handmade by an Italian craftsman in a remote city — it even smells of fresh leather when you unbox it at first. The beautiful and minimalist style comes without any metal detailings (except on the belt closure), magnets, or hidden pockets. It’s a very straightforward leather piece that you close by inserting the little front strap through the loop. Despite the lack of zippers or fasteners, we were pleasantly surprised to find it remaining closed the entire time. There are also enough belt loops to tie it snug against the waist, which increased the number of ways we could style this bag. But the one-inch depth was too slim to fit both a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>phone in its case</a> and a wallet side by side. We had to swap some cards and coins into a card holder in order to make it all fit.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-78 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>1 <strong>| Material: </strong>Leather<strong> | Size: </strong>W 6” x H 3.5” x D 1.0”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-most-practical-caraa-sling-bag></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Most Practical</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Caraa Sling Bag</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=800 data-sizes=750px alt="Caraa Sling Bag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/GXZj2F2OUrnuqW3hDPh6XLBsWP0=/fit-in/1500x800/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Caraa-Sling-Bag-e61733d7d79b4e9fba47aa0fc1accad6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Caraa</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The faux leather almost looks like real leather.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The two side zippers on the front are just for decoration.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-81 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Offered in various sizes, colors, and textures, this leather bag (also available in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">vegan leather)</a> works for pretty much all situations. It’s quite large in size, so it’s ideal for anyone who needs a little more room than many of these other stylish bags offer, like mothers or avid travelers who like to keep their hands free. We were able to stuff snacks (yes, snacks plural, as in you can fit granola bars, a pack of cheez-its, and more in here), a passport, a handkerchief, multiple beauty products, and of course, a wallet and a phone. We did find it a little odd, however, that the two zippers on the sides of the outer pocket don’t really lead to anything. While there is very tiny space inside, it’s only good enough for perhaps a few quarters. We believe this serves more as a design element than anything else.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-82 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>8 <strong>| Material: </strong>Leather, antique gold, nylon <strong>| Size: </strong>W 10.5” x H 4.5” x D 3.6”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-hiking-beis-travel-the-sport-sling></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Hiking</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Beis Travel The Sport Sling</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Beis Travel The Sport Sling" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/FcxuvYZ2Fxcm5ZJzEyGcbHO8h5Y=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Beis-Travel-The-Sport-Pack-62abc0939013449dad834f3039ec824b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Beis Travel</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>There is a separate pouch to hold an entire water bottle, and can be packed away when not in use.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It can’t be worn around the waist.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-85 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To set expectations right, this Beis bag is theoretically a sling, not a belt bag. With its impressive amount of pockets (we counted nine compartments), and an entire water bottle holder, it was too good not to include. It’s been especially useful on our long hikes in Los Angeles (where it’s extra hot) and tennis adventures, where frequent hydration is required. It’s been a dream to simply expand out the little pouch that’s otherwise neatly packed away in the back pocket, and place our extra large water bottles in it. When not in use, the pouch stays hidden, keeping the overall look of the sling clean. On top of the front slit where we kept our iPhones for easy access, there’s a zipped pocket that conceals three card holders. The main pocket is very large — large enough to even hide a book — and features a separate zippered mesh pocket as well, where we kept our sunglasses. In short, we continue to be amazed at all the functions of this bag, as if we never stop discovering new features and pockets. The key leash allowed us to further organize our belongings. Needless to say, it’s almost impossible to lose anything in this bag.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-86 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>3 <strong>| Material: </strong>Nylon, faux leather, recycled polyester<strong> | Size: </strong>W 6.7” x H 8.2” x D 2.7”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-87 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Emily Cieslak</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-quilted-mz-wallace-metro-belt-bag></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Quilted</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>MZ Wallace Belt Bag</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="MZ Wallace Metro Belt Bag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/-Z7Ug5aCxNyEGWASEmK5VSPrx-E=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/mz-wallace-metro-belt-bag-bc07ba2f0cf346f6b499da253f29f4df.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>MZ Wallace</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The quilted details continue up the strap a little as well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>We wish the zipper detail wasn’t red.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-90 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We wanted to switch up the style a little, and a quilted belt bag felt very current and trendy. It allowed us to pair it with more than just athleisure, but a nice coat into town as well. Although we have to say, the red detailings on the zipper threw off the clean aesthetic a little, but that’s a personal preference. Otherwise, we loved that the quilting goes beyond just the bag, but into the belt a little as well. There are four compartments — a little zipped pocket in the front, and a main pocket that features another zip closure on one side and an open pocket on the other. While it might not be enough for an adventure on the mountain, it’s ideal for everyday needs and casual outings into town.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-91 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>1 <strong>| Material: </strong>Nylon, leather<strong> | Size: </strong>W 8” x H 5” x D 2”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-customizable-monogram-mary-the-fanny-pack></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Customizable</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Monogram Mary Fanny Pack</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Monogram Mary The Fanny Pack" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/eK-7E-jbk8XA6mhW-T8zN5Uyv7Y=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Monogram-Mary-The-Fanny-Pack-708bb231ef41458d8768ed78353ba696.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Monogram Mary</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The customization capabilities are near endless, with tons of fonts, formats, and colors to choose from.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It doesn’t have a lot of side pockets and compartments.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-94 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This option comes highly recommended by Sturino, who finds the gold accents extra chic and the ability to monogram your initials very unique. While you only have the option to choose between two and three letters, you have 30 styles, twelve fonts, and 32 color options to pick from and have stitched into the bag. You even have the choice to add a little icon, like a mermaid or martini glass, onto the design as well. While the pack itself isn’t boasting a lot of pockets and compartments, it is big enough to hold a couple of essentials for a little outing. It’s the ideal little gift to get a group of friends on a weekend out together.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-95 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>4 <strong>| Material: </strong>Nylon<strong> | Size: </strong>W 10” x H 6” x D 3”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-other-options-you-might-like></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Other Options You Might Like<br></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Nomatic Navigator Sling 6L</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This is probably the most innovative and thoughtful sling bag to have ever been created for travelers. Nomads and wanderers alike have plenty of reasons to love this bag, starting with the harder exterior shell that’s water repellent (as are the zips) and the breathable back that keeps you from drenching in sweat. There’s a second tiny strap safely stored in a little pouch that you can pull out and clip on for extra security, keeping the bag from sliding around your shoulder. The main strap also holds a little card holder, so you can easily grab your metro card and swipe in. As for the compartments, there are two main pockets large enough for a variety of things: Electronics, such as our 17 inch tablet and our iphone charger, went into the back pocket, while our everyday needs, like wallets, makeup, sanitizers, and passports fit into the front pocket. The bag manages to do all this while remaining sleek and small, ideal for on the go. Outside of travel, however, we’re not sure we would need all of these fantastic amenities in our everyday lives.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">AIKENDO Slim Running Belt</a>- running, OSP&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Runners, gather around and appreciate this slim running belt. Emphasis on slim, as the tiny pouch lies flat against the body with no real width to it. Still, we were able to fit a phone, granola bar, headphones, and keys. As a matter of fact, there’s an extra little hook for your keys that can then be tucked into its little pouch, so that it remains secure during the duration of your run. The bag itself is also water and sweat-resistant, which kept it from spoiling any time we began sweating through our clothes. With a reflective strip on the front pocket, we felt safer running at night knowing that any oncoming traffic would be able to spot us. The bag never got in the way of our training, allowing us to forget it’s even on until we needed to change the song on our phones. While it’s not the bag for everyday wear or cute strolls into town, it’s fantastic for a long training session.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">CORALDAISY Vegan Leather Sling Bag</a>- convertible, vegan leather, OSP&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We featured our best leather option, so it’s only fair to spotlight a vegan leather piece as well. This bag had that same sleek and elevated look as the Quince one, but with more pockets and space to store things. We were impressed with just how soft and quality the bag was, despite its affordable price. It felt plush and soft yet sturdy, ready to protect all that’s inside while keeping us comfortable. The adjustable strap that can be hooked to either the right or the left corner of the bag was a nice touch, allowing us to switch shoulders when one got tired (also lefty-friendly). One random — but worth pointing out — con we noticed was that the zipper clasps bang against each other and sound like bells, which can get annoying.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Vera Bradley ReActive Mini Sling Backpack</a>- convertible fanny/sling</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Vera Bradly is known for their flashy designs, but luckily this sling is offered in a sleek black as well… with a floral interior. We were very impressed with how durable and strong this bag was, while fitting a large quantity of items (including over the ear Bose headphones). The outer pocket makes it easy to grab our phones quickly, and the side zip of the main compartment made it easy to slide things in and out of it. While it can sit around the waist, we felt it was too bulky and awkward over our thigh. It also suits athleisure better than any kind of nice going out outfit, so keep that in mind as you shop.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-our-testing-process></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Our Testing Process</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We first started by searching the internet for the most popular and well rated belt bags, sling bags, and fanny packs.

Something to bring on your hike? Or perhaps a stylish statement? The bag you choose should fit your needs accordingly. For stylist Ashleigh Ashton, a belt bag that has both ample amounts of pockets and still looks elevated is essential while she’s on her gigs. “For me the perfect appeal in a belt bag is comfort and functionality.

Sturino considers them to be “the most comfortable and convenient rendition of a purse, a true life hack.” It’s more than just having your hands free — that much a simple shoulder bag can do as well. But the belt bag doesn’t infringe in your full range of motion one bit. A shoulder bag might slide off, but a belt bag, whether strapped around your waist or slung across your body, will remain secure at all times. This is precisely why it’s so handy during active moments, like exercise or travel.

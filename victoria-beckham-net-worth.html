Made up of Melanie “Mel B” Brown, Melanie “Mel C” Chisholm, Emma Bunton, Geri Halliwell, and Victoria herself, the Spice Girls quickly became a cultural phenomenon. Each member was given a moniker, with Victoria’s being “Posh Spice.” Their debut album, Spice, released in 1996, sold over 20 million copies worldwide and featured the chart-topping single “Wannabe,” which held the coveted No. 1 spot on both the Billboard Hot 100 and Billboard 200.</p><p>Their success didn’t stop there, as their second album, Spiceworld, and its accompanying musical film, Spice World, solidified their status as the world’s most influential girl group. Their 1998 Spiceworld Tour became the highest-earning female group concert tour of its time, grossing a staggering $17.8 million worldwide. After disbanding in 2001, Victoria went on to embark on a solo career, launching with the single “Out of Your Mind.” However, despite a few chart-topping singles and a self-titled studio album, Victoria’s time with the Spice Girls is what ultimately defined her musical career.</p><p>Victoria’s aspirations, however, went beyond music as she delved into the world of fashion, solidifying her status as a style icon throughout the 90s and early 2000s. She is also known for her philanthropic work, receiving the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2017.</p><p>In her personal life, she and her <a href=# data-type=pmc_list data-id=1650647>husband David Beckham</a> are parents to four children: Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz, and Harper. As a couple, they have combined their entrepreneurial endeavors, amassing a substantial joint net worth. But with her own career spanning music, fashion, and even television appearances, Victoria Beckham’s net worth is impressive on its own.</p><p>For everything we know about how much Victoria Beckham is worth today, keep on reading below.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=20.655737704918><h2>What is Victoria Beckham's net worth without David Beckham?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/david-beckham-victoria.png><p>Victoria Beckham’s personal net worth is currently estimated to be around $70 million. When combined with her husband <a href=# data-type=pmc_list_item data-id=1646422>David Beckham’s net worth</a>, this figure gets even more astronomical—but before diving into that number, let’s remember how Victoria Beckham’s net worth came to be what it is today.</p><p>When Victoria Beckham was 20 years old, she auditioned for the Spice Girls. Little did she know that this would lead to a spectacular—and very, very lucrative—career. As the most successful girl band of all time, the group <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/david-victoria-beckham-net-worth-sunday-times-rich-list-tgs6f8983>reportedly</a> raked in approximately $72 million (£60 million) per year during the 90s. Later, the Spice Girl’s 2008 reunion tour added an estimated $60 million (£50 million) to each member’s wallets. Even today, Victoria continues to receive royalties, merch income, and earnings from her time with the Spice Girls, providing her with a constant stream of income.</p><p>Transitioning from her days as a pop sensation, Victoria eventually ventured into the world of fashion. Her eponymous fashion label has become a global phenomenon. In 2022, the brand’s revenue increased by 13%, valuing it at nearly $50 million (£40.9 million). This success only continued to grow, with annual revenue surging by 42%, propelling the label’s worth to an estimated $70 million (£58 million.)</p><p>In addition to her personal ventures, Victoria Beckham’s net worth is also helped by numerous brand deals. One such deal was her appearance in the 2007 Tesco Christmas advert alongside her fellow Spice Girls, which brought in a cool $1.2 million (£1 million.) A few years later, she signed a lucrative $14.5 million contract with the high-end brand, Armani. Notable collaborations extended to her partnerships with Estée Lauder, where she released two collections in the 2010s, both of which flew off the shelves. This successful endorsement eventually led her to establish her own beauty line, Victoria Beckham Beauty, in 2019.</p><p>These figures only scratch the surface of her wealth. When we consider her impressive property portfolio and joint ventures with her husband David Beckham, Victoria Beckham’s net worth is even bigger than you’d think.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=12.5><h2>What is Victoria Beckham & David Beckham's combined net worth?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/david-victoria-beckham.png><p>According to the Sunday Times Rich List, Victoria and David Beckham’s combined net worth is estimated to be an astounding £425 million (around $515 million).</p><p>David Beckham, renowned as one of the greatest footballers of all time, achieved most of his wealth through a combination of soccer club wages and multiple endorsement deals with global brands like Pepsi, Adidas, and Armani, to name a few. Like his wife Victoria, David has been smart enough to dip his toes into all kinds of business ventures. In 2022, the footballer sold half his shares of his global brand management firm, DB Ventures, to Authentic Brands Group, pocketing an impressive $230 million from the deal.</p><p>Today, David boasts a personal net worth of around $450 million. While he may have the lion’s share of wealth, there’s no doubt that Victoria and David Beckham are a power couple thanks to their numerous joint investments and ventures together.</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.

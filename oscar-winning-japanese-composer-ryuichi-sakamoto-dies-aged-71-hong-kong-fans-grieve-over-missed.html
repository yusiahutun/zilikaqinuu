class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fans around the world were shocked by news of Sakamoto’s death as they flooded the musician’s Instagram page with messages of condolences, while Hong Kong supporters expressed regret they had missed their final chance to see him in person.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In April 2020, Sakamoto was supposed to come to Hong Kong to showcase his unique brand of electronic music performance, titled dis·play, at the West Kowloon Cultural District.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component

visit to the city in over a decade, but was postponed to September that year due to the emerging Covid-19 pandemic. As the health crisis worsened and with all tickets sold out, the show was again rescheduled to 2021.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It was a pity that we have to postpone the performance in Hong Kong again, but we promise to reschedule the performance date so that everyone can enjoy it. I sincerely hope that everyone is well and see you again,” Sakamoto told his Hong Kong fans at the time.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But the legendary musician’s show was eventually cancelled due to his ailing health.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Apart from his individual repertoire, Sakamoto was also known for his work with the pioneering electronic band Yellow Magic Orchestra (YMO) which he co-founded.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hong Kong singer-songwriter Adrian Fu Chee-yat never got the chance to see Sakamoto perform live, calling it a “big regret”.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">How Ryuichi Sakamoto found music to convey the essence of champagne</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The 45-year-old – who has collaborated with Eason Chan Yik-shun, one of Cantopop’s biggest stars – described how when he first listened to “Absolute Ego Dance” from YMO’s 1979 Solid State Survivor album, he was “completely in awe of how they were able to push electronics into their artform”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The renowned composer helped him realise that music could be much more than the standard three-minute pop structure many are familiar with.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“His name may not be well-known in the general diaspora, but boy – his music was ubiquitous, wasn’t it?” Fu mused.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fan and filmmaker Edwin Lee discovered Sakamoto’s music when watching the film The Last Emperor as a teen.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Back then I didn’t really watch such epic dramas, but I was also enthralled by the grand sweeping score by Sakamoto. It introduced me to the ‘cinematic soundtrack’, and I subsequently delved more deeply into the genre,” the 39-year-old said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/04/03/2f4d9ed0-cdf1-43ea-8a59-7051af41a87f_a71259b7.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In cinema, Sakamoto was most remembered for his scores for The Last Emperor and Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence, among other films.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sakamoto started playing piano as a toddler. He studied ethnomusicology at the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music, with particular interest in the traditional music of Japan’s Okinawa prefecture as well as Indian and African musical traditions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Embracing electronic music, he and fellow studio musicians Haruomi Hosono and Yukihiro Takahashi formed YMO in 1978.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The band’s groundbreaking use of a vast array of electronic instruments brought it domestic and global success.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/04/03/c82f6c65-d0d1-4b59-b519-f8ef86bf86f9_a4814c14.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sakamoto’s first score was for the 1983 film Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence, in which he also played the commandant of a camp for prisoners of war, starring alongside David Bowie. The score bagged a win at the British Academy Film Awards.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His most celebrated work was 1987’s The Last Emperor in which he also had an acting role. The score won an Oscar, a Grammy and a Golden Globe.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2014, Sakamoto took a break from work for about a year to be treated for throat cancer.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2017, the musician released his first album Async since his recovery. On the track “Fullmoon”, he created a conceptual ambient piece inspired by text from American author Paul Bowles, with the music featuring samples of the passage narrated in several languages, including Cantonese and Mandarin – performed by Hong Kong artists Tang Kit-ming and Priscilla Leung Siu-wai.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Bowles’ text reads: “Because we don’t know when we will die, we get to think of life as an inexhaustible well … How many more times will you watch the full moon rise? Perhaps 20. And yet it all seems limitless.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Cancer-beating composer Ryuichi Sakamoto puts his life on film</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Hong Kong artists were connected to Sakamoto by local radio DJ and music critic Wong Chi-chung, who became friends with the musician after an interview in 1989.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Speaking to the Post in 2017, Wong said he was asked to find a female voice to narrate Bowles’ text in Mandarin. He called on his friends. “But none of it worked out until Priscilla Leung came on board. She has a voice that is mature, wise and dramatic,” Wong noted.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Leung told the Post in the same interview that when she was first asked to do the vocal performance for Sakamoto’s album, Bowles’ text was all she had.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The text is a simple message about life experience. I understand the background, and what Sakamoto has been through. So I used a lot of imagination. I had a feeling that he was searching for life experiences from others,” she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/04/03/c9c1178d-28a7-4b68-9b9e-6e9c46bccabc_d6665435.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Wong revealed Cantonese was initially not included in the track, but in the end, Tang’s narration also made it to the final cut. Wong, also a film script writer, mentioned it was an honour to contribute to Sakamoto’s project after listening to and playing his music on air for many years.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Last December, Sakamoto gave a farewell concert online for fans. He had announced in January 2021 that he had been diagnosed with rectal cancer, and by June that year was battling stage four cancer.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In an October message on Instagram about the concert, Sakamoto said: “I don’t have the energy to do live concerts … This might be the last time that you will see me perform in this manner.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0mifqKaXYriwusZoqqibmZrBunvAq6uim5yafHR%2BkG5ucmpfpMCkrdFmrqKmnp67qHnJmqeappWosm6vzqanqKuVp3qzxdSimqGhXaiurK3MqKuoZZSesrR5wKCcnWVnZnqpu82gZKSnnpx6p63NrGSgqpmaw6Z5zq%2Bcq2WdnsC0scM%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./shenzhen-based-kaisa-groups-kwok-hiu-ting-becomes-largest.html>&#171;&nbsp;Property magnates 26-year-old daughter buys Sing Tao, sends Hong Kong papers shares soaring by</a>

What started as a mere seed has grown into a remarkable facility that has helped countless individuals.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>A Holistic Approach to Behavioral Healthcare</h3><p>Agape Treatment Center, founded in 2016, is a behavioral healthcare company located in West Palm Beach, Florida. It is a cutting-edge leader in providing drug and alcohol addiction treatment services.

direction when we last checked in with New Jersey's finest, we all knew that wasn't going to last ... since Chris filed for divorce in January of this year. On the latest hour, the final days of their marriage played out, as Pivarnick made it pretty clear things between them went downhill after last season wrapped.</p><p>"Coming home from Florida, I really did have high expectations for Chris and I.

She claimed that the night before she left, she and her husband got into another big blowout.</p><p>"And as he was walking out of the f---ing room he was like, 'F--- you, bitch. I hope you f---ing die in a plane crash,' knowing I was going to Spain," she said in a confessional. "This is not a f---ing marriage. He doesn't communicate with me. He doesn't even show me attention. I have to take this opportunity for myself."</p><p>And that she did. But while she apparently had a blast filming the show, which debuts next week, she returned home to a totally empty house.</p><p>"I really didn't have communication with Chris too much. Of course, he's nowhere to be found," she said after she got back to Jersey. "This is the perfect representation of how our relationship is as a whole.

This person that's literally cancer. I have so many texts in my phone that people would be f---ing ... they would be like, 'What the f--- did you stay with this guy for?'" she continued in a confessional.

I thought things were going to change, they didn't change, they got worse.

And I'm the only one that's married," she told her sister. "This one guy, Luis, he started calling me 'Amore' and then he started speaking Spanish to me. He's attractive, speaks Spanish, chiseled abs. He's hot.'</p><p>"Luis is a guy that gave me attention in Spain," she continued. "I felt like a woman again and I was like shocked. I haven't had that in a long time."</p><p>She explained that, at the moment, she and Chris weren't even talking ... and shocked her sister by revealing that they only had sex one time while they were married. "I would be butt ass naked and he wouldn't even look at my body," she added.</p><p>That being said, her sister still didn't think it was a great idea for her to spend NYE with another guy. While Angelina agreed, saying, "Nothing good is going to come of any of this," she did it anyway.</p><p>During her getaway, she started sending <a href=#>Mike "The Situation" Sorrentino</a> photos of her with Luis. Initially, everyone thought they were just pictures from Spain -- until closer inspection of the images made them realize they were new and in Mexico. Mike, of course, sent them to everyone else in the cast.</p><p>"That is not Chris!" exclaimed <a href=#>Pauly D</a>, while <a href=#>Vinny</a> showed them to his dog and said, "Look, Angelina's cheating on her husband." <a href=#>Snooki</a>, meanwhile, simply thought Luis "looks like me as a boy."</p><p>As Angelina returned from Mexico, she said that "a lot of s--- happened." Footage showed her getting home to find Chris had packed up all his things and seemingly wanted her to return her wedding ring. "It's been a whirlwind of f---ing craziness," she said, before inviting <a href=#>Deena Nicole Cortese</a> to gossip about what really happened between them.</p><p>"He moved out," she revealed, as Deena asked if her going to Cancun was the reason. "There's a lot of story you don't know," she teased, as the episode then came to an end.</p><p>We'll see the relationship drama continue to play out all season, as new episodes of "Jersey Shore Family Vacation" drop Thursdays on MTV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7j29ma2tfn7Kzv8SyZKygn6eybq3NoJyloZ6WerG11Zqpp6GToHqltdWoqZydXw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./harlow-andrus-bio-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Biography &amp;amp; Other Facts of Nancys daughter Harlow Andrus</a>

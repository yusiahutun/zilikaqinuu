The country royalty has sold over 90 million copies throughout her life as a country singer, and she’s not stopping any time soon.</p><p>McEntire was discovered while singing the national anthem at a radio and captured the eye of country singer Red Steagell. After the stint, she signed to Polygram/Mercury Records and released her first single “I Don’t Want to Be a One Night Stand,” which initially failed to take off as it only peaked at number 88 on the&nbsp;Billboard&nbsp;Hot Country Songs&nbsp;chart. However, things <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/lists/the-voice-judges-salaries/>started to pick up</a> as she switched labels and released her albums Just a Little Love, My Kind of Country, Have I Got a Deal for You, Whoever’s in New England, What Am I Gonna Do About You, and more. She’s been nominated for 17 Grammys and won three.</p><p>In 2001, she starred in her own sitcom called Reba that ran for 6 years. In January 2024, NBCUniversal ordered a pilot for a new series with the country singer. “Reba inherits her father’s restaurant and is less than thrilled to discover that she has a new business partner in the half-sister she never knew she had.”</p><p>The “Seven Minutes In Heaven” singer has also been in high profile relationships. She was previously married to producer and manager Narvel Blackstock for 26 years before they divorced in 2015. “Things started going south with my marriage. Narvel Blackstock, my manager and husband at the time — we got a divorce, and the shocker of it all was, there were four people who were taking care of all my business,” she told <a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=link data-id=https://people.com/country/reba-mcentire-on-taking-charge-of-her-career-after-divorce/>People at the time</a>. “I had my production manager who left, I had my CEO who left, my manager and husband, and my father had died. So four men who were rock and pillars of my world were gone.”</p><p>The divorce taught her a <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/tv-movies/1679804/how-to-watch-the-voice/>valuable lesson </a>about her finances. “I started taking over signing the checks and then I started realizing how much water cost, and the electric bill, and all the things that was going on in my life,” she added. “I made the money, I brought it home. So it was a huge, huge change for me.”</p><p>So what is Reba McEntire’s net worth?

There are a few clues on their social media accounts that suggest they’re no longer together—the biggest of all is that he doesn’t follow her on Instagram and it looks like she’s deactivated hers altogether. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">All of his updates are of him only.&nbsp;</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Screen-Shot-2023-11-14-at-2.30.04-PM.png><p>During a teaser for the October 30, 2023, episode, Daniele and Yohan got into a huge fight after she learned something “devastating” about her husband. “We need to have a conversation Yohan,” Daniele told her husband as he cleaned the kitchen. In a private confessional, Daniele revealed she learned something “very devastating” about her husband and she “didn’t know what do with it.”</p><p>“Are you done?” Yohan said in Spanish. There aren’t any clues as to what the fight was about, but Daniele screams: “Get the f—ck out of my house,” she screamed. “You are out of your mind, and I don’t want you here.” Later, it’s revealed that <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>he took money out</a> of her bank account without asking and lied about it.</p><p>“You want to humiliate me over 4,000 [approx. $70 USD] pesos that I took from your card?” he asked her in another episode. “No, <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>it’s because you lied</a>, because of your lying,” she said, while he kept trying to interrupt her. “I can look it up now, it’s more than 4,000 pesos,” she continued; “Look it up,” he challenged. She opened her banking app to scroll through several more charges, one of 5,000 pesos. “This is a nightmare,” she said. In a confessional later, she said, “In total, Yohan made four withrdawals of a total of $160, but this has nothing to do with the amount of money he took out. I wouldn’t even mind if he needed to take money out, the problem is that I asked him if he took it and he said no.”</p><p>Fresh from 90 Day Fiancé: Love in Paradise, this couple is no stranger to the struggles of living separate lives in different countries. In The Other Way, Daniele left her home and job in NYC in an effort to convince Yohan to make the Dominican Republic their forever home. “When I met Yohan, I felt an instant connection with him,” she told producers. “But it was immediately clear that our relationship would face a lot of challenges.” One month later, he proposed.</p><p>While a language barrier does provide its challenges for the couple, they felt a deep spiritual connection that they felt could help them overcome any difficulties. “Before this week, we’ve always talked about me moving to the Dominican Republic,” the New York native admitted ahead of their wedding. “But as we get closer, and closer to the wedding, it seems like he’s more and more adamant about him moving to New York City, which makes me really suspicious.” Yohan later revealed that he had hoped to move to the United States to work and send money back to his family in the Dominican Republic.</p><p>They tied the knot in November 2021 and recently celebrated their first year of marriage in November 2022. “One year of marriage, a lifetime’s worth of learning,” Daniele wrote via Instagram. While they’ve also been shown in the show to fight over things like money and electricity bills, it appears the couple is still going strong. “Blessed to be able to do this together.” as she shared <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">a loving Instagram post</a> dedicated to him on Valentine’s Day 2023, a post that has since been deleted.&nbsp;</p><p>“When @yohangeronimo and I first started dating, he told me I needed a lot of patience. I figured I was a teacher of a room full of immigrants who spoke 14 languages, none of them English,” she wrote. “How could I possibly not have patience? I learned that marriage patience is different from teacher patience. In both cases, if you don’t have patience, you’ll lose your job or your partner. I managed to keep both this year, which feels like a huge win. I love you with my entire heart, and I’m grateful to you for teaching me both how to be patient and how to love unconditionally.”</p><p>The two also adopted a puppy to extend their family. “I feel like it’s a way for us to start our family together,” she explained in an episode. “It’ll give us responsibilities that we can share and something to play with. I feel like [it] will be really good prep for when we have a baby.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6KqratfrLWwedKtoKWkXam8qLHToZyrZWlleqWt2GadopmemLJuwMeeZKismJq%2FbsPAsmSsnZGovK95lGg%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./can-shorts-ever-be-too-short.html>&#171;&nbsp;Can Shorts Ever Be Too Short?</a>

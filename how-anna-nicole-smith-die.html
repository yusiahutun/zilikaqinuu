She filed her will in July 30, 2001 and left everything to her son Daniel. Her partner Howard was named executor in the will.&nbsp; During the case hearing of where her bodied would be buried, Howard said of the mother-son bond, ” he said. “Anna and Daniel were inseparable. Daniel was without question the most important person in Anna’s life. From the time I met her, everything was for Daniel,” he said. “I would say that physically, she died last week, but in a lot of ways, emotionally she died when Daniel died.” Anna reportedly climbed into her son’s coffin during his funeral.</p><p>Before her death, Anna Nicole Smith was embroiled in a paternity lawsuit with her ex-boyfriend Larry Birkhead for her daughter Dannielynn. Anna affirmed that Howard K. Stern was the father of the child. Two months after her death, it was revealed that Larry was indeed the father of Dannielynn. “I’m the father,” Larry said after the . “Thank you for your support. Thank you for the people who got me this far. Thank you very much. My baby’s gonna be coming home pretty soon. Things are moving quickly here, and we’ll see what happens.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Larry and Howard were amicable once the results were announced and hugged outside the court room. “We’re gonna do what we can to make sure that the best interests of Dannielynn are carried out,” Howard said. “And I’m going to do whatever I can to make sure that he gets sole custody. Larry can come over to the house and spend as much time with [Dannielynn] as he wants to right now.”</p><p>Anna Nicole Smith: You Don’t Know Me is now available to stream on Netflix.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/jerry-springer-net-worth.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1><i>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.

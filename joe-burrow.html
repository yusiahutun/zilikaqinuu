Funny enough, it was enough to make people predict the Bengals win.&nbsp;</p><p>Nothing better than the diamond, eh?&nbsp;</p><p>Oozing with confidence, Burrow walked in a full fur coat, a black roll neck, a chain, and Cartier shades. He truly lived up to his nickname, “Joe Brrr,” that day.&nbsp;</p><p>Blown away by his looks, the swagger QB was asked about his ‘JB9’ pendant. To which he replied,</p><p>“They’re definitely real. I think I make too much money to have fake ones.”</p><p>He then further added,</p><p>“So these are real.”</p><h2>Parenthood & Early Career of Joe Burrow</h2><p>Joe Burrow was born Joseph Lee Burrow in Iowa, United States.

The series' third episode introduces the story of John Graff (Joe Mantello), a former owner of the house who had his own lethal history. Read on to learn what we know about the Graff character's connection to a real 1971 family massacre.</p><h2 data-node-id=2 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Who is John Graff in 'The Watcher'?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Watcher viewers first hear the name Graff in a story told by private investigator Theodora Birch (Noma Dumezweni), who patriarch Dean Brannock (Cannavale) has hired to investigate the anonymous letters. In the show, Graff was a mild-mannered father and accountant who moved into 657 Boulevard with his wife, his mother, and his two children. The father's mental state slowly deteriorates as he receives the Watcher letters, which taunt him about his family issues and his recent firing from his job. Eventually he murders each member of his family one-by-one, and flees after leaving their bodies in the house for the neighbors to find weeks later.</p><img alt="the watcher joe mantello as john graff in episode 103 of the watcher cr eric liebowitznetflix © 2022" title="the watcher john graff true story john list murders" width=1800 height=2700 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/watcher-103-unit-00482rc-1666560901.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Eric Liebowitz/Netflix</span></p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What is the John List case?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">List was a father of three who lived with his wife, his mother, and his children in the real-life town of Westfield, New Jersey, in the early 1970s. The seemingly mild-mannered man lived in similar circumstances as the character Graff; he struggled to maintain a job and siphoned his mother's bank accounts of $200,000 in order to keep up appearances, per <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://apnews.com/article/0abc5141429eda579004f6cf677bbae6 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Associated Press" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Associated Press</a>. In November 1971, List fatally shot the five members of his family, fleeing their home and leaving behind a five-page letter to his pastor, confessing to the murders.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Several similarities to the List murders were included in John Graff's storyline. Per the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/28/magazine/28List-t.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="New York Times" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">New York Times</a>, the List family's Westfield home was a large "19-room ramshackle Victorian" with a Tiffany skylight. Though List had two sons rather than Graff's one, both the real man and the character had a 16-year-old daughter named Patricia.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The show's massacre scene is also very similar to real events; List fatally shot his wife, Helen, and mother, Alma, first, waiting for Patricia and his 13-year-old Frederick to come home from school before shooting them as well. He also took a break during the homicide to eat lunch, before attending his 15-year-old John's soccer game, driving him home, and killing him. Both List and Graff also cut themselves out of family photos and left after turning on all the lights in the house and playing organ music.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What happened to John List?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After his crime, List lived on the run for nearly 18 years. In 1989, he was captured in Richmond, Virginia, where he'd been living under the alias "Robert Clark." At the time, List lived a similar life as before the killings; he had remarried, had found new work as an accountant, and was active in the Lutheran church.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">His capture was credited to the show <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/25/nyregion/25list1.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="America's Most Wanted" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">America's Most Wanted</a>, which featured him as the subject of its May 21, 1989, installment. For the episode, producers brought in a forensic sculptor who studied List's old photos and created a bust imagining what he might look like as an older man. He was then identified by a neighbor, and authorities arrested him at his work less than two weeks after the episode aired.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In April 1990, List was convicted on five counts of first-degree murder and received five life sentences. He lived the rest of his life in prison, before dying from complications of pneumonia in March 2008.</p><img alt="the watcher episode 101 of the watcher cr eric liebowitznetflix © 2022" title="the watcher john graff true story john list murders" width=2000 height=1333 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/watcher-101-unit-00390rc-1666560983.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Eric Liebowitz/Netflix</span></p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What happened to John Graff?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Like The Watcher's other unfinished storylines, viewers never learn what happened to Graff after he fled. In the show's timeline, the murders occur in 1995, and Graff has yet to be apprehended by the time the Brannock family moves into the house. In episode 3, as Dean hears the full story from Theodora, he slowly realizes that the mysterious "building inspector John" he met just hours before could be the killer, returning to the house to see what's become of it. (Mantello plays both Graff and the building inspector.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As the episodes continue, we learn that the fake building inspector is involved with the Brannock's neighbors Pearl (Mia Farrow) and Jasper (Terry Kinney), and has snuck into 657 Boulevard as part of the Westfield Preservation Society. Though the show never confirms that the man is Graff (he introduces himself as William "Bill" Webster), there is a moment where another character seems to recognize him, and asks about his family. Despite the copious hints, the man's confirmed identity remains a mystery as The Watcher ends.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/81e105b4-86bd-4dab-a1f8-e00063b9e433_1609381211.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Quinci LeGardye" title="Headshot of Quinci LeGardye" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Quinci LeGardye is an LA-based freelance writer who covers culture, politics, and mental health through a Black feminist lens.

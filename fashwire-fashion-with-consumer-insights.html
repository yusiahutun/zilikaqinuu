It is the usefulness and problem-solving ability of these products/services that make these companies highly sought-after and successful.</p><p>In search of these revolutionary companies, today we talk about <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>FashWire</a></strong>. FashWire is a company reshaping the Fashion industry. The company provides offerings that are changing the fixed image and carving the new era of the Fashion industry.</p><p>The company and its solutions are highly acclaimed and one of the leading names providing unrivaled products. FashWire and its team are a mix of industry experts and fashion visionaries, pooling their skills and expertise to provide a unique and unmatched service and customer experience.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=the-company-and-its-journey-so-far>The Company, and its journey so far</h2><p>The company runs under the parent company – Wire Holdings, Inc. The parent company has two products, FashWire and GlossWire. FashWire is focused on the Fashion industry, and GlossWire is oriented towards the Beauty industry.&nbsp;</p><p>FashWire began its journey in 2015, with its headquarters based in Seattle, Washington. The company aims to provide contemporary fashion, with a keen focus on consumer choices and demands. They achieve this through a two-sided marketplace and data-driven consumer insights.&nbsp;</p><p>Their mission is to reframe the fashion world by providing consumers a unique opportunity to discover brands and trends while delivering their brand partners critical customer feedback. They are striving day in and out to provide a marketplace that has genuine products, dedicated customer support, and of course, the latest trends and designs.</p><p>FashWire was the first to be founded under its parent company, thus making it a challenge for the team. The team had to develop a service that will not only create a new trend but also a one-stop destination for women and men.&nbsp;</p><p>FashWire’s high-growth two-sided discovery and shopping marketplace provides its portfolio of designers and brands vital data into consumer shopping behavior patterns. Giving fashion designers real-time valuable insights through a seamless user experience makes FashWire the digital front runner in consumer global business intelligence.&nbsp;</p><p>For consumers, FashWire creates a compelling interactive experience by combining immersive swipe voting and social integration to influence the designer instantly. Through its market-leading app and web experience, FashWire customers can shop a curated edit of 30,000+ products, sourced from over 400 contemporary designers and brands from 40+ countries. The company is owned by Wire Holdings, Inc. recently launched GlossWire in the multibillion-dollar beauty industry and is backed by a range of all-star private angel investors in the beauty, fashion, and tech spaces.</p><p>The challenges were relentless, but so was the team’s spirit and zeal to bring a change. Their journey is to be ahead of the curve while <a href=#>creating a digital platform</a> connecting consumers and brands in the fashion industry.&nbsp;</p><p>With so many years in this journey, they have successfully created a platform where customers can shop hassle-free without any worry, and brands can put up their best products forward.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=what-makes-fashwire-a-leading-fashion-destination>What makes FashWire a leading fashion destination?</h3><p>To get widespread awareness and maximum footfall, the team targeted fashion trade shows to directly get the platform in front of the brands and prove the technology at the tech shows. Exhibiting at ShopTalk gave them exposure to Google and they launched in 2018 with a Google partnership.</p><p>After this, the FashWire brand base began rising to over 200 by the end of 2019. During the pandemic when retail was shut down, the fashion designers and brands they connected with at the trade shows, that initially were not interested, joined the platform. Today, FashWire has over 400 designers from more than 40 countries on its platform and continues to grow daily.</p><p>This exponential rise in the success of FashWire, pushed the team to delve deeper into other industries, leading to the launch GlossWire in February of 2021, which uses the same innovative technology for beauty brands. Before the launch, 50+ beauty brands signed up to be on the GlossWire platform based on the success with FashWire. GlossWire has quickly grown to over 150 brands and proved its concept when they were named a finalist in WWD’s Project Connect.</p><p>Adding another vertical, with a successful launch, helped the team to gain more valuable insights and visibility, which propelled the growth of both platforms.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=fashwire-s-unmatched-products-and-new-additions-to-their-arsenal>FashWire’s unmatched products, and new additions to their arsenal</h3><p>FashWire is a B2B2C marketplace providing its brand partners vital real-time data and actionable insights into consumer shopping patterns. The designers and brands then receive this data allowing them to make smarter production decisions driving conversion, repeat purchases, and profitability.</p><p>FashWire aims to provide consumers a unique opportunity to discover brands and trends by leveraging technology to engage shoppers across all channels. User interaction is a key differentiator and combining that experience with deep data and hyper-curated content makes FashWire a highly coveted solution for emerging and established brands.</p><p>With this unique approach to understanding consumers and providing organic discovery of worldwide fashion, they have achieved immense success in the Fashion industry.&nbsp;</p><p>FashWire’s team is constantly enhancing its technology to integrate into its platform, to elevate the user experience for consumers and brands.

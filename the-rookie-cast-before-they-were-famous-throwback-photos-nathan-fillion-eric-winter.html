Extremely close to both of his parents, the TV star has also spoken of his endless admiration for his older brother, Jeff. Pictured with his sibling above, it's pretty easy to spot Nathan, although he's sporting a shorter haircut these days!&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Nathan knew he wanted to be an actor from a young age, but with limited options in Edmonton, the fledgling star took a practical approach and decided to become a teacher. While he may have studied for a degree at the University of Alberta, the 53-year-old ultimately decided to pursue a career in acting, heading to New York where he landed his earliest TV roles. And we're so glad he did – it wouldn't be The Rookie without John Nolan.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">Read more</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Nathan Fillion's life and career in photos - see the star's incredible transformation over the years" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/1715db95caf4-nathan-fillion-close-up-from-ozark-premiere.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Nathan Fillion's life and career in photos - see the star's incredible transformation over the years" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Nathan Fillion's life and career in photos - see the star's incredible transformation over the years</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Eric Winter's life and career in photos - from California childhood to Roselyn Sánchez romance and The Rookie role" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/949a32d9f11b-eric-winter-close-up-monte-carlo-tv-festival.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Eric Winter's life and career in photos - from California childhood to Roselyn Sánchez romance and The Rookie role" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Eric Winter's life and career in photos - from California childhood to Roselyn Sánchez romance and The Rookie role</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Meet Nathan Fillion's rarely-seen lookalike brother Jeff" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/0635a1c34860-nathan-fillion-and-jeff-fillion.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Meet Nathan Fillion's rarely-seen lookalike brother Jeff" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Meet Nathan Fillion's rarely-seen lookalike brother Jeff</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/b1c379355bb3-eric-winter-with-dad-throwback-photo.jpg><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=b1c379355bb3-eric-winter-with-dad-throwback-photo>Eric Winter</h2><p dir=ltr>Eric Winter was born in La Mirada, California, and while little is known about his childhood, the 47-year-old has given fans a glimpse of his favourite trends from way back when.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>"This is what happens when you go through old pics... probably took me 45 mins to blow dry my hair that perfectly," he joked on Instagram.

At just 17, she won 2005's , becoming the first female winner, the first winner of Chinese descent and the youngest winner in the show's history – an impressive feat.</p><p dir=ltr>After releasing several albums and heading to Broadway, Melissa committed her full attention to acting in 2015, bagging roles in (2015-17), (2015), (2016) and (2018) before joining in 2018.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/df446a790505-jenna-dewan-cheerleader-throwback-photo.jpg><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=df446a790505-jenna-dewan-cheerleader-throwback-photo>Jenna Dewan</h2><p dir=ltr>Born in Hartford, Connecticut, Jenna Dewan had lived in seven different cities by the time she was seven.

In her senior year, Jenna was also voted prom queen.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>For Jenna, dancing was her first foray into the creative arts, and she appeared as a backing dancer for artists including Missy Elliott, Janet Jackson, and Christina Aguilera during the early days of her career.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>After bagging minor roles in film and TV shows, Jenna got her big break when she was cast as Nora Clark in the hit dance film, (2006), and the rest, as they say, is history!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/67ef945341f0-mekia-cox-throwback-photo-virgin-islands.jpg><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=67ef945341f0-mekia-cox-throwback-photo-virgin-islands>Mekia Cox</h2><p dir=ltr>Mekia Cox recalled how she got started in showbiz. Chatting to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow><strong></strong></a>, she said: "I started dancing first when I was about two and a half years old, and I moved into singing kind of in elementary school then middle school.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>"And it was probably in the beginning of middle school that I really got into acting. I was born in The Virgin Islands and we moved up to Orlando.

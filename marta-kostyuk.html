Marta Olehivna Kostyuk is her full name. On October 30, 2017, she attained a high-career junior ranking of world No. 2 for the first time. She suddenly gained fame in the ongoing Transylvania Open where she is preparing to compete against US Open 2021 champion Emma Raducanu.</p><h3>Early Life</h3><p>Marta Kostyuk was born in Kyiv, Ukraine, on June 28, 2002. Oleh Kostyuk and his wife Talina Beiko have a daughter named Marta. Her father was the technical director of the Antey Cup, a junior tennis event in Kyiv, and her mother was a professional tennis player who rose to No. 391 on the WTA rankings and won a $10,000 title in her hometown of Kyiv in 1994. Kostyuk began playing tennis when she was a child at the Antey Tennis Club on Kyiv’s west side, where she was instructed by her mother.</p><p>She remembered her first tennis experience when she was five years old: “My mother was constantly busy as a coach, and the first time I went to the tennis courts to practice, I realized that if I started playing tennis, I’d be able to spend more time with her. So that was my motive – if I played tennis, I’d be able to spend more time with her “.. Taras Beiko, her maternal uncle, who had played for the Soviet Union and Ukraine in the late 1980s and early 1990s, also coached her. Mariya Kostyuk is one of her siblings.</p><h3>Marta Kostyuk Career</h3><p>At the Australian Open, Kostyuk made her main draw tour-level debut. She overcame Arina Rodionova, Daniela Seguel, and <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Barbora Krejková</strong></a> to become the first player born in 2002 to participate in a Grand Slam main draw after receiving a wild card admission into the qualifying tournament. Kostyuk became the youngest player to win a main-draw match in Melbourne since Martina Hingis in 1996 by defeating Peng Shuai in the first round. She beat Australian wild card, Olivia Rogowska, in straight sets in the second round.</p><p>Marta became the first player under the age of 30 to reach the third round of a Grand Slam event since Mirjana Lui-Baroni did so in the 1997 US Open. She was ranked fourth in the tournament. In 2013, Kostyuk had a winning record against players ranked 11–20 in the world. Kostyuk has a career-high rating of No. 2 on the junior circuit, which she attained on October 30, 2017. She won the 2017 Australian Open girls’ singles titles after winning the Petits As in 2016.</p><h4>Rise to Fame</h4><p>Kostyuk won the $60k ITF Cairo in February. In addition, she and Kamilla Rakhimova won the Cairo doubles competition. Following a season-long hiatus caused by the COVID-19 epidemic, she competed in the Palermo Open qualifiers, reaching the second round, and the Prague Open qualifying, qualifying for the main draw. In the first round of the US Open, she defeated Daria Kasatkina, a former top-10 player, in straight sets. She then defeated Anastasija Sevastova, a past semifinalist. In the third round, she faced Naomi Osaka, a previous champion and world No. 9.</p><p>Marta won the second set in a tie-breaker to overcome the first-set deficit but was defeated in the third. She beat former French Open winner Garbie Muguruza 6–1 and 6–4 in the first round of the French Open. She advanced to the fourth round when she was defeated by Iga Swiatek, the defending champion. At the Transylvania Open 2021, she was defeated by <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Emma Raducanu</a></strong> in the quarterfinal. Her most recent performance in the Australian Open 2023 secured her place in the Third Round and she is all set to face <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Jessica Pegula</a></strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><table><tbody><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Marta Kostyuk Biography</h3></th></tr><tr><td width=40%>Real Name</td><td width=60%>Marta Olehivna Kostyuk</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Date</td><td>28 June 2002</td></tr><tr><td>Age (as of 2023)</td><td>20 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td>Kyiv, Ukraine</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>Ukrainian</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Tennis Player</td></tr><tr><td>Religion</td><td>Christianity</td></tr><tr><td>Sun sign</td><td>Cancer</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Physical Statistics</h3></th></tr><tr><td colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Marta-Kostyuk-2.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>in feet inches&nbsp;<strong>– 5’ 9” – </strong>in Centimeters <strong>– 175 cm</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>in Kilograms&nbsp;<strong>– 60 kg&nbsp; –&nbsp; </strong>in Pounds&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp; 132 lbs</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Shoe Size</td><td>8 (U.S.)</td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td>Blonde</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td>Blue</td></tr><tr><td>Body Type</td><td>Athletic</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Family</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Father</td><td>Oleg Kostyuk</td></tr><tr><td>Mother</td><td>Talina Beiko</td></tr><tr><td>Sister</td><td>Mariya Kostyuk</td></tr><tr><td>Brother</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Qualification/Education</h3></th></tr><tr><td>School</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>College</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Relationship Status</h3></th></tr><tr><td colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Marta-Kostyuk-3.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td>Single</td></tr><tr><td>Affair</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Boyfriend</td><td>None</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Personal life</h3><p>Marta’s personal life is not known in public as she keeps it a secret but she is right she is just 19 years old and is focusing mostly on her career.

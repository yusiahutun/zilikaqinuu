In an interview with the people, she stated:</p>I used to tease him and be like, Could you please hurry up and get a wife?

However, O’Neal has never formalized any of his relationships with his girlfriends. That said, do you know Shaq’s girlfriend now? Here is a list of the women that Shaquille has been involved with romantically.</p><h3>1. Shaunie O’Neal - (1998 - 2009)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a699c275b5c538a3.jpg><p class=align-left>Shaunie was Shaq O’Neal’s wife.

Shaunie <a id=https://www.gossipcop.com/shaq-wife-girlfriend/1066/ href=# rel="nofollow noopener">suspected </a>Shaq of infidelity and even hired a private investigator to track his moves and confirmed that he was cheating on her. As a result, they separated and later divorced.</p><h3>2. Karrine Steffans (2004 - 2005)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a852a2259ad5198c.jpg><p class=align-left>In what seemed like a perfect rebound, Steffans was Shaquille’s girlfriend after Shaunie. However, their affair was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">short-lived</a>, as they called it quits one year later. Karrine is a video vixen and the author of <i>Confessions of a Video Vixen</i>.</p><p class=align-left>In her book, she recounts her sex escapades with famous people, including athletes. However, she reiterates that O'Neal wasn't 'stingy' with his money and that within four months, the basketball legend had spent more than $40,000 on the Video Vixen.</p><h3>3. Nicole Hoop Alexander - (2010 - 2012)</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f0493ca58191a756.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Robert Burale's wife?

She became furious and dramatic that they got into a heated <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">argument</a> with O'Neal. Shaquille decided to end their relationship on that day, and they never reconciled.</p><h3>4. Laticia Rolle - (2014 - 2018)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c73d11a2bfd0250b.jpg><p class=align-left>Laticia Rolle is an American model and former professional basketball player.

So what transpired between this outstanding female personality with America's all-time NBA male basketballer?</p><p class=align-left>The two <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">met</a> in Florida at a bar where Rolle was working as a hostess in 2014. In 2017, Laticia posted a huge engagement diamond ring on her Instagram, expressing her joy. However, in 2018, there were reports of the two <a href=# title rel="nofollow noopener">parting ways</a>, and they have never been spotted together ever since.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0311672a72bdf410.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Does Jennifer Aniston have kids?

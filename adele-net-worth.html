The record delivered some of <a href=# id=auto-tag_adele data-tag=adele>Adele</a>‘s most successful tracks to date, including her stunning ballad “Hello,” which reigned in the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100 charts for ten weeks in a row upon its release. Since then, Adele has largely stayed out of the limelight and focused on matters in her personal life—including her <a href=#>divorce from Simon Konecki</a> in 2019 and her new relationship with <a href=#>boyfriend Rich Paul</a>.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/adele-postpone.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Female-Artist-With-MostGrammys.png><p>In 2021, however, fans were finally blessed with the news of <a href=#>Adele’s new music</a>. The “Chasing Pavements” singer released her latest album, 30, in November 2021. Given how excited fans were for the release, there’s no doubt that Adele’s net worth is only going to grow. But how much is Adele’s net worth to begin with? For everything we know about how much Adele makes, just keep on reading below.</p><h2>How much does Adele make per concert?</h2><p>Like most music artists, Adele earns the bulk of her revenue from touring—and the figures for her concert earnings are truly eye-watering.</p><p>Her last tour, which ran from 2016 to 2017 in support of her third studio album&nbsp;25,&nbsp;reportedly earned a whopping $252 million (£142million) in ticket and merch sales combined. The company in charge of her tours—which, we might add, Adele is the sole director of—took a $128 million (£72million) cut from these earnings, leaving Adele with an impressive $74 million for her own pocket (£42million), per <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Sun</a>. This means the singer was earning around $685,000 per night&nbsp;(£500,000) during her world tour.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/adele-boyfriend.png><p>Now, these earnings are only bound to increase, as the “Set Fire to the Fire” singer confirmed her Las Vegas Residency, titled Weekends With Adele, at the Colosseum of Caesars Palace Hotel from January 2022 through April 2022. The residency was delayed due to technical difficulties and started in November 2022. Prior to announcing the news, a source previously revealed to The Sun&nbsp;that “Adele has very recently been talking to musicians that she has worked with before to gauge their availability, to see whether they could be in Vegas for the gigs.”</p><p>Another insider added, “It is all very exciting. It would make her a lot of money but it would also mean she could have a routine. It would be hugely lucrative for her but also really fun.” According to&nbsp;The Sun‘s estimation, this deal alone could double Adele’s net worth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Adele-30.jpg><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$9.97+</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias=buy-now__original-price data-alignment data-theme=product-price-strikethrough data-transform data-truncate>$11.98</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-percentage-off data-transform data-truncate>17% Off</span></p><h2>How much does Adele make a year?</h2><p>Adele’s yearly salary has steadily increased ever since began her professional music career in 2008. She released her debut album,&nbsp;19, and reportedly earned around $10 million that year, per Celebrity Net Worth. Adele followed the success of her first record with 21 in 2011, which landed her a whopping six <a href=#>Grammy Awards</a>. According to Celebrity Net Worth, the singer earned around $15 million that year.</p><p>In 2012, the singer released “Skyfall” for the James Bond movie of the same name. The single landed Adele her first Academy Award, another Grammy and a Golden Globe Award. By the year’s end, the singer had earned an estimated $18 million. Her success was so great that she continued to bring home millions during her three-year hiatus, earning $30 million in 2013 and a whopping $70 million in 2014.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Adele-7.jpg><p>If that wasn’t impressive enough, Adele’s yearly earnings kicked up once again following the release of her third studio album, 25,&nbsp;in 2015. While she earned on $60 million that year, she continued to rake in tens of millions more in the six years she spent out of the recording studio after releasing&nbsp;25.&nbsp;In 2016 and 2017, the singer earned a combined $150 million, whereas 2018 and 2019 brought in an additional $40 million.</p><h2>How much did Adele and Simon Konecki’s divorce cost?</h2><p>Adele married Simon Konecki in 2016 after five years of dating. The pair welcomed their only son, Angelo, in 2012. Adele announced her separation from Simon in April 2019 after seven years together. “Adele and her partner have separated,” her rep said in a statement to the Associated Press at the time. “They are committed to raising their son together lovingly.” The “Hello” singer cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for their split.</p><p>In 2020, news broke that Adele did not have a prenuptial agreement with Simon. While the details of their divorce were largely kept private, reports soon revealed that the former couple reached a $190 million divorce settlement in January 2021. According to <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Sun</a>, Adele was ordered by a judge to pay a $140 million majority of this settlement to her ex-husband. The former couple additionally agreed to work out their property and debts through mediation, along with having shared custody of their son.</p><h2>What is Adele’s net worth in 2023?</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel=nofollow>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Adele’s net worth is $220 million as of 2023. This figure does not yet include her music earnings from her fourth studio album, 30,&nbsp;so fans can likely expect to see Adele’s net worth get even bigger following its release. Adele’s ex-husband, Simon Konecki’s net worth pales in comparison at an estimated $2 million as of 2021. Meanwhile, her boyfriend Rich Paul is worth an impressive $100 million thanks to his career as a professional sports agent for athletes like Lebron James.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Time</a> in 2015, Adele explained why she doesn’t relate to the word “brand.” “I don’t like that word,” she said. “It makes me sound like a fabric softener, or a packet of crisps. I’m not that.” She continued, “There’s personality in an artist, and if you’re expecting people to let you in and give themselves to you, you have to be a whole package.”</p><p>Adele also told Time about her favorite artists are ones who have remained humble despite their success.&nbsp;“I feel like some artists — and this isn’t shading any artist, just me trying to come up with my own explanation — the bigger they get, the more horrible they get, and the more unlikable,” she said. “And I don’t care if you make an amazing album — if I don’t like you, I ain’t getting your record. I don’t want you being played in my house if I think you’re a bastard.”</p><p>She also explained to the magazine why her family is off limits when it comes to her “brand.” “I think it’s really unfair for anyone to want unlimited access to my family when we’re not a brand,” she said. “Some people do, and if you’re happy to do it, then kudos — that’s fucking great. But I don’t want my family to be part of my package. If my kid decides that when he’s old enough to make his own decision that he wants to be known for being my kid, I’ll be annoyed, but I won’t stop him. I’ll be like, ‘It’s your choice now.’ But this was my dream. This isn’t theirs.”</p><p>Adele also explained to Time why she feels it’s important to stay true to herself despite how much her life has changed. “The fact that I’m not shy or embarrassed to be falling apart,” she said. “Everyone falls apart, I think. A lot of people try to be brave and not shed a tear. Sometimes when you know someone else feels as shitty as you do, or approaches things in a certain way just like you do, it makes you feel better about yourself. Even though my music is melancholy, there’s also joy in that. I hope I do bring joy to people’s lives, and not just sadness, but I think there’s a comfort in it. But I honestly don’t know. If I knew, I would bottle it, and sell it to everyone else.”</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Elle</a> in 2022, Adele also revealed the meaning behind her 2021 hit single, “Easy on Me.” She revealed to the magazine that she wrote some verses for “Easy on Me” in the shower and that the song made her think about how “lost I was when I left my marriage.” (Adele and her husband, Simon Konecki, divorced in March 2021.) “A lot of my friends throughout that rainy period of my life kept saying to me that, ‘You have to go easy on yourself, don’t beat yourself up too much about your decisions,’” she said. “It just really, really stuck with me that, like, I have to be kind to myself.”</p><p>Adele also told the magazine about how her “lyrics have probably changed a bit over time in terms of my vocabulary growing, considering that I started out when I was 19.”She continued, “But, you know, they always tell about the same thing: me, and seemingly, my failed relationships. Which is crazy ’cause I actually don’t feel like that, but yeah.”</p><p>Adele told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">British Vogue</a> in 2021 that she wrote 30 and “Easy on Me” to explain her divorce to her son.&nbsp; “I just felt like I wanted to explain to him, through this record, when he’s in his 20s or 30s, who I am and why I voluntarily chose to dismantle his entire life in the pursuit of my own happiness,” she said.&nbsp; She continued, “I feel like this album is self-destruction, then self-reflection and then sort of self-redemption. But I feel ready. I really want people to hear my side of the story this time.”</p><p>Adele talked about the moment with her son that motivated her to go into the studio to write the new music. “[Angelo] said to my face, ‘Can you see me?’ And I was like, ‘Uh, yeah.’ And he was like, ‘Cause I can’t see you.’ Well, my whole life fell apart in that moment,” Adele told Vogue. She also opened up about the questions Angelo asked her after her divorce from his father. He said things like, “‘Why don’t you love my dad anymore?’ And I’d be like, ‘I do love your dad. I’m just not in love.’ I can’t make that make sense to a 9-year-old.”</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.

The Sunday Express was first to report that the sixth-in-line to the throne had found love with Suits actress Meghan. November 2016 Romance rumours intensified after <a class=hm-link href=#>Harry was spotted celebrating Halloween</a> with his Toronto-based love at the city's Soho House.

In the rare statement made in response to the harassment, "sexism and racism" Meghan had received, Harry asked for privacy. In the heartfelt post, he acknowledged that there is "significant curiosity about his private life" but appealed to fair-minded people to respect Meghan's privacy. He said he was also "worried" and "deeply disappointed" that he had not been able to protect the Toronto-based actress.</p><p id=escz3VGBFVjC data-wc=38>A few weeks later, Meghan was spotted shopping at Whole Foods supermarket on Kensington High Street, confirming rumours that she was visiting Harry and staying at his nearby Kensington Palace home.

Harry's tour commitments finished in early December, when he reportedly took a detour to spend precious time with Meghan in Toronto, instead of flying straight home. The Prince travelled 1,700 miles out of his way.</p><p id=eLjRYd54_rXT data-wc=112>A couple of weeks later, they were reunited when Meghan flew to London. Keeping a low profile, Harry and Meghan went shopping for a Christmas tree at Pines and Needles in Battersea. "They came in at about 8.30pm last night," a spokesperson for the shop told <strong>HELLO!&nbsp;</strong>. "Prince Harry was with Meghan and hilariously the staff only recognised Meghan at first â they were so excited to have the girl from Suits there. It wasn't particularly cold but they were gloved and hatted out." A couple of days later, Harry and Meghan were pictured enjoying a night at the theatre at The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time.</p><h2>January 2017 - Romantic time in Norway</h2><p id=eehMcdsTkRPq data-wc=41>Harry and Meghan kicked off the New Year with a <a class=hm-link href=#>romantic getaway to Norway</a>.

Harry took his girlfriend to the Meno a Kwena camp in Botswana â a place that he has visited on several occasions since his first stay 20 years ago. A source at the time said: "Harry has been planning this holiday for a long time. He's made the trip incredibly romantic. They'll go on boats across the lake, walk in the bush at dawn and camp under the stars."</p><h2>September 2017 - Meghan Markle in Vanity Fair interview</h2><p id=euvI8EZ0-yzb data-wc=64>Meghan spoke openly about her relationship with Harry for the first time in an interview with Vanity Fair. The Suits actress, who had been dating the Prince for over a year at this point, told the magazine that the couple are "<a class=hm-link href=#>very happy and in love</a>". "I can tell you that at the end of the day I think it's really simple," she said.</p><p id=eN1zgXk28407 data-wc=101>"We're two people who are really happy and in love. We were very quietly dating for about six months before it became news, and I was working during that whole time, and the only thing that changed was people's perception. Nothing about me changed. I'm still the same person that I am, and I've never defined myself by my relationship. We're a couple, we're in love. I'm sure there will be a time when we will have to come forward and present ourselves and have stories to tell, but I hope what people will understand is that this is our time."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/45218ab5933c-meghan-markle-and-prince-harry-at-invictus-z.jpg><p id=euegrmtRqf data-wc=83>Later that month, Harry and Meghan <a class=hm-link href=#>made their official debut</a> as a couple at the royal's Invictus Games, which were held in Toronto.

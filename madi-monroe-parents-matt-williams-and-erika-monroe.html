But following eight months of dating, Madi and Matthew’s relationship ended, and one TikTok had her followers worried.</p><p>Fans were devastated by the mere hint that Madi and Matthew were breaking up when her video appeared on TikTok. Fortunately, when Madi heard the stories had spread, she said that wasn’t the case. Madi responded to the page’s post shortly after The Tea Talk published her video and refuted any conflict between her and Matthew.</p><p>“Not about Matthew, LMFAO,” Madi commented. “Just a post, Jesus.”</p><p>Many readers questioned why Madi would post about a breakup and expect her supporters not to assume the worst, despite the fact that she said she and Matthew were on good terms.</p><h3><strong>Meet Matt Williams, Madi Monroe Father</strong></h3><p>Madi Monroe thinks that her father Matt Williams is the “coolest dad.”</p><p>Matt is the son of Sally and Arthur Williams.

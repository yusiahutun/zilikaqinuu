The Dawson’s Creek cast features James Van Der Beek as Dawson Leery and Katie Holmes as his childhood best friend, Joey Potter. The two deal with the emotional rollercoaster of growing up while harboring secret feelings for each other. Also coping with the trials and tribulations of adolescence is Pacey Witter (Joshua Jackson), often referred to as the “town loser,” and Jen Lindley (Michelle Williams), the new girl next door.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/Copy-of-then-and-now.jpg><p>The series, which ran from 1998 to 2003, always started with the iconic theme song “I Don’t Want to Wait,” by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Paula Cole</a>, though that wasn’t the original pick for the drama. The song written specifically for the show was titled “Run Like Mad,” by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jann Arden</a>. But after the former was used for the show’s promotional advertisements, Warner Bros. executives decided on Cole’s tune, though “Run Like Mad” was used to open a few episodes and eventually replaced the original song when the show hit Netflix in 2020.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Dawson’s Creek about?</h2><p>Dawson’s Creek takes place in the fictional coastal town of Capeside, Massachusetts, its title coming from protagonist Dawson Leery, who lives on the town’s creek. And the creek itself is an integral part of the show as Dawson and Joey live on opposite ends of it, with Joey often referring to herself as “the girl on the wrong side of the creek.” As noted, the show follows their tumultuous friendship and gradual romance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/2_687720.jpg><p>As the friends work through the curveballs life throws at them, they also tackle everyday issues such as mental health and loss. On top of all of that, Dawson’s Creek gave us the most thrilling back-and-forth love triangles of all time between Dawson, Joey, and Pacey.</p><p>And then there was the original love triangle between Joey, Dawson and Jen, which flared up every now and then throughout the series. Yikes.</p><p>In 2003, Dawson’s Creek came to an end after years of back and forth between the love triangle(s), as well as the on and off relationships between … well, all the characters. While the show was always supposed to have Dawson and Joey as the endgame couple, audiences got to see Joey with Pacey, much to the joy of many — including Katie Holmes herself. The showrunners said that Holmes fought for her character to end up with Pacey, which felt like a more honest storyline.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/Copy-of-then-and-now-1.jpg><p>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">cast reunited in 2018</a> for the show’s 20th anniversary, posing for the cover of Entertainment Weekly and being interviewed by the magazine.</p><p>See what the Dawson’s Creek cast has been up to since the show’s ending.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>James Van Der Beek as Dawson Leery</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/3_5c947a.jpg><p>As the lead of the Dawson’s Creek cast, there wouldn’t have been a show without <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">James Van Der Beek</a>. He started acting at the age of 13 in school productions and eventually off-Broadway shows. When he auditioned for the role of Dawson, Van Der Beek was attending Drew University in New Jersey as an English major, hoping to later become an actor. Of course, he booked the role at age 20, left the university and the rest is history.</p><p>Since the show’s ending nearly 21 years ago, Van Der Beek has starred in the films Varsity Blues (1999) and The Rules of Attraction (2002), and was part of the main cast of the series Mercy (2010), Don’t Trust the B—– in Apartment 23 (2012 to 2013), Friends with Better Lives (2014), CSI: Cyber (2015 to 2016) and Pose (2018). In 2019 he participating in Season 28 of Dancing with the Stars.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/dont-trust-the-b-in-apartment-23_nyh7RG.jpg><p>Van Der Beek was married to fellow actress <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Heather McComb</a> from 2003 until their divorce in 2010. They met through McComb’s sister, who worked with him on an episode of Dawson’s Creek.</p><p>In 2009, he met current wife Kimberly Brook on a trip to Israel. He shared in an Instagram post for their 10-year anniversary, “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I was in Israel</a>, on a trip with an organized group, when it hit me: I was done being single. I wanted a real relationship. A soulmate…rattling all this off to a friend of mine when a voice interrupted us… it was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">@vanderkimberly</a>.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/GettyImages-1711688226.jpg><p>The couple now have six children and recently relocated to Texas from Los Angeles. Van Der Beek has been on a bit of a break from acting since their move and has been focusing on his family.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Katie Holmes as Joey Potter: Dawson’s Creek Cast</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/4_325d93.jpg><p>The girl from the wrong side of the creek really outgrew that line after the series ended in 2003. In 2004, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Katie Holmes</a> starred in the films First Daughter and Batman Begins (2005).</p><p>Though Holmes’ character ended up with Pacey in the series finale of Dawson’s Creek, that wasn’t the case in real life. Homes and Jackson did have a brief romance early on in the show’s run, but they never discussed the relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/GettyImages-645134403.jpg><p>In 2006, Holmes married fellow actor, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom Cruise</a>, who <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">declared his love for her</a> on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 2005. The two welcomed their first child, Suri Cruise, a few months before their wedding. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Katie said, “All I can say is the moment I looked in her eyes, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I felt like … Mom</a>.”</p><p>After all the commotion of their relationship, Holmes and Cruise divorced in 2012. Since then, she had been in a 6 year relationship with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jamie Foxx</a>, but is currently single.</p><p>Katie Holmes’ most recent projects have been the film The Secret: Dare to Dream (2020) which just landed on Netflix, as well as Alone Together (2022) and Rare Objects (2023).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Joshua Jackson as Pacey Witter</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/5_84522d.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Joshua Jackson</a> was meant to be in the Dawson’s Creek cast. The self-proclaimed “town screwup” originally auditioned for the role of Dawson, which he almost got, but eventually scored the role of Pacey. The show’s screenwriter, Kevin Williamson, explained, “The network said they didn’t see Josh as Dawson, and rightfully so. So, I went, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘Okay, he’s Pacey</a>,’ because I knew I wanted him in the show no matter what.”</p><p>Since the series ended, Jackson has starred in films such as Americano, Aurora Borealis and Shadows in the Sun (all 2005). His television career also thrived after the show’s ending. From 2008 to 2013, Jackson starred in the series Fringe, while in 2014 he got the part of Cole Lockhart in The Affair, which lasted until 2019. A year later, he became <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reese Witherspoon</a>’s husband in the series Little Fires Everywhere (2020).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/fringe_zQKs7c.jpg><p>In 2019, Jackson tied the knot with actress and model, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jodie Turner-Smith</a>. The couple welcomed their daughter, Juno Rose Diana, in 2020. However, they recently split at the end of 2023 and filed for divorce.</p><p><strong>MUST-READ:</strong> <a href=#>12 Best Mystery Series on Amazon Prime, Ranked — Unleash Your Inner Sleuth!</a></p><p>Jackson’s most recent roles were on the Paramount+ mini-series, Fatal Attraction (2023) as well as the series Dr. Death (2023).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Michelle Williams as Jen Lindley: Dawson’s Creek Cast</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/6_cbcabb.jpg><p>The new girl from New York was meant to cause some chaos for the comfortable Dawson and Joey, but <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Michelle Williams</a> was a much needed addition. Sure, her presence riled up Joey and excited Dawson, but her character broke a lot of barriers. Jen sadly had an untimely death in the series finale due to a heart condition (RIP Jen!), leaving her friends, her Grams and her 1-year-old daughter behind.</p><p>After the series came to an end, Williams’ career took off. She went on to star in a number of movies including, Brokeback Mountain (2005), Blue Valentine (2010), The Greatest Showman (2017) and I Feel Pretty (2018). Williams has also won two Golden Globes: one in 2012 for her role as Marilyn Monroe in My Week with Marilyn (2011) and one for her role in Fosse/Verdon (2019).</p><p>In 2004, Williams met her partner, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Heath Ledger</a>, while filming Brokeback Mountain. The two never married, but they had a daughter, Matilda, in 2005. Williams and Ledger split up in 2007, just five months before his shocking death. In 2020, she married current husband, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Thomas Kail</a>, whom she welcomed son Hart with the same year.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kerr Smith as Jack McPhee in the Dawson’s Creek Cast</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/7_594dd4.jpg><p>Introduced in Season 2, Jack’s appearance may have shook up the lives of Dawson and Joey, but he made our hearts flutter!

With a partying phase, rehab stint and readjustment to college life, Audrey was on a rollercoaster ride.</p><p>After the series, Philipps acting career took off. In 2004, she got a part in the movie White Chicks. Then in 2005, she booked her own series, Love, Inc., but that only lasted a single season.

But, his married life with Whoopi ultimately failed, and they went through a divorce.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Later, his ex-wife talked about her failed marriages in a book.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>After his divorce from Whoopie, tabloids didn't cover much about him, leaving the audience to spread false rumors about his death.&nbsp;In this article, let us&nbsp;learn about Lyle Trachtenberg's life, his wife, kids, bio information, and his whereabouts. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-198 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Whoopi Goldberg's Previous Relationships</h2><p>The View veteran is one of the few entertainers to have won an Oscar, an Emmy, a Grammy, and a Tony award, also collectively known as the EGOT.&nbsp;Whoopie enjoys a staggering net worth of $45 million.</p><p>The famous television host/actress&nbsp;previously married Alvin Martin in 1973.&nbsp;The couple welcomed their daughter, the American producer and actress Alexandra Martin, born when Goldberg was just a teen.&nbsp;They were together for a couple of years until they called it quits in 1979</p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-199 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>After Alvin,&nbsp;The&nbsp;View moderator, tied the knot with the&nbsp;cinematographer, David Claessen, on 1 September 1986, and they divorced two years later in 1988.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>Then, it was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> that the actress had a fling with American actor Red Danson. They met the following year she got divorced from&nbsp;Claessen. They appeared together on the famous late-night talk show, The Arsenio Hall Show. Soon, a friendship blossomed between the two, and after four years, they were again cast alongside each other in a movie named Made in America in 1992. It was then their controversial affair started.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>Whoopi was single at the moment as she had been recently divorced, but Ted, on the other side, was married to his wife, Cassandra Coates. While the stars tried to keep their relationship a secret, some gossip tabloids were not far away from the reach of the truth; Tabloids like National Enquirer heavily featured the news, which then reached to the ears of Ted's ex-wife.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>After 16 years of togetherness,&nbsp;Cassandra filed for divorce; The divorce was settled with a whopping $30 million, one of Hollywood's costliest divorces. In 1993,&nbsp;Cassandra, along with her two children, walked out of Ted's life.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-600 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>Two years later, Ted married actress Mary Steenburgen on 7 October 1995. They met working in the film&nbsp;Pontiac Moon.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>Coming back to Ted and Whoopi's relationship, they stayed together for one year and a half. They then called it quits without revealing the reason for the split.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>Some sources reported that he had dumped Whoopi under his parent's pressure. Sharing about her subsequent break-up, she told Closer:&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>It was really painful, and it was very public. And the loss of his friendship hurts a great deal. We can never go and have a soda, anywhere.&nbsp;I'm friends with almost every man I've gone out with, except this man.</p><p style=text-align:justify>However, she gave love another chance and got married for the third time. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-601 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span><h2 style=text-align:justify>Ex-Wife Whoopi&nbsp;Goldberg Speaks About Divorce</h2><p style=text-align:justify>The hard-hitting blue-collar veteran, Lyle Trachtenberg, married the Hollywood actress Whoopi Goldberg on 1 October 1994 after dating her for&nbsp;nine months.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>The marriage is said to have lasted only for a year.

She also said that she should have never got married. She said,&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>"I suppose you have to actually be in love with the person you marry. You have to be committed to them. I don't have that commitment. I'm committed to my family. No, I wasn't in love with my husbands. It's the truth. I wanted to feel normal and it seemed to me if I was married I'd have a much more normal life."&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>During the talk show interview, the actress also retrospected that she was never ready for serious&nbsp;commitments, stating, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-603 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>"That's not a good reason to get married. You have to actually want a life with someone through ups and downs and I discovered that wasn't for me."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify>However, she did reveal that she was once in love&nbsp;with a man. When she was asked whether the mystery man was her ex-boyfriend Ted Danson, an American actor. She said,&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>"(I was in love) once. A man. You're asking me if I was in love with Ted? Is that the man I'm talking about? No. No (you don't know him) and that's the beauty. I snuck a couple in on y'all! It was a long time ago. We talk all the time - he's got two great kids and a great wife."</p><p style=text-align:justify>She further added that she was never a frequent dater, indicating,&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>"I never was much of a dater. I'm not a real go-out kind of person. I'm a singular person."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p style=text-align:justify>Later, In an interview with Dailymail on 11&nbsp;November 2014, Goldberg briefed about balancing&nbsp;expectations and true love with other aspects of life, saying,&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-604 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>âI've realized there are certain things you have to come to terms with in life, like managing your own expectations, telling the truth, reconciling true love with other aspects of your life, including wealth or even celebrity.â</p><p style=text-align:justify>Again, in an interview&nbsp;in January 2017, Whoopi&nbsp;revealed that she was the reason behind her failed marriages, saying,&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>&nbsp;"It took me some time but I realised that trying to turn myself in to something I wasn't ready for a man wasn't his fault. It was mine.&nbsp;My marriages failed and I was the common denominator.&nbsp;My commitment was never that strong. I can say now that I was never really in love. The realisation freed me up."</p><p style=text-align:justify>Lyle's ex-wife Whoopi&nbsp;Goldberg also wrote a book in 2015&nbsp;titled,&nbsp;If Someone Says 'You Complete Me' Run!,&nbsp;about her failed relationships.&nbsp;</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Lyle Trachtenberg Married&nbsp;Actress-Turned Marketing Director&nbsp;</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Lyle, whose Japanese name is written&nbsp;Ã£ÆÂ©Ã£âÂ¤Ã£ÆÂ«Ã£ÆÂ»Ã£ÆËÃ£ÆÂ©Ã£âÂ¯Ã£Æâ Ã£ÆÂ³Ã£ÆÂÃ£ÆÂ¼Ã£âÂ°,&nbsp;has been lucky in the family department.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The union representative, Lyle, has been married to former actress Adrianna Belan, born in Canada.&nbsp;They have two daughters together, namely, eldest daughter Gabriella Trachtenberg and youngest daughter Natasha Trachtenberg.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Whoopi&nbsp;Goldberg's ex-husband Lyle Trachtenberg with his girlfriend-turned-wife and kids </strong>(Photo: Adriana's Belan Facebook)</p><p style=text-align:justify>The happy family of 4 went together to a march organized by the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, a United States-based labor union,&nbsp;in March 2018.</p><p style=text-align:justify>According to her LinkedIn profile, Lyle's former actress wife Adriana has been working as the Director of Marketing for the company named Timothy Cline Insurance.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>What Is Former Actor Upto?</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Travis Tedford in 2017; Where is He Now After All The Young Age Acting?</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>Adriana very much deserves her position in the said reputed company as she worked hard for it.

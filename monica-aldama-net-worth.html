There’s a reason she’s been called the “Queen” of cheerleading.</p><p>Monica was born on February 9, 1972, in Corsicana, Texas. She graduated from Corsicana High School and was a student at Tyler Junior College, where she was a member of the cheerleading team. In January 1995, Monica started as the head cheerleading coach at Navarro College, where she led the team to more than dozen National Cheerleaders Association championship wins in the Junior College COED Division. In 2020, Monica became a household name after she and the Navarro College Bulldogs were featured in Netflix’s docuseries Cheer, which followed her team and the weeks leading up to the annual NCA Championship in Daytona, Florida.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Insider</a> in 2020, Monica revealed what viewers didn’t see in Cheer.&nbsp;“I think the fact that the crew filmed 12 hours a day for months, and had to edit it all down to just six hours is mind-blowing,” she said. “I never imagined how much time and work goes into making a docuseries — it’s so much more than I could have ever fathomed. There were so many things we did that weren’t shown or didn’t make it into the six episodes. I’ve seen comments from fans that they’re surprised that prelims take place and then finals, because that wasn’t shown. On the show, they only show the final competition. But prelims are the day before and we compete there and then turn around and compete at finals the next day in order of how you’re ranked at prelims. So there’s a lot of stuff that was filmed that didn’t quite make it in the final cut.”</p><p>So how much is <a href=# rel=noopener>Monica Aldama’s net worth</a> and what does she make as Navarro Cheer’s coach?
